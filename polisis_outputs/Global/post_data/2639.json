you provide to us.This Privacy Policy and Terms (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through our website located at www.mclaren.org, the websites of our subsidiaries that display or directly link to this Policy, and the e-mail messages that we send to you that directly link to this Policy (collectively, the

information that identifies you as an individual, such as name, birth date, telephone number, e-mail address, or unique device identifiers that was gathered in connection with your use of the Services.\nIf we combine Personally Identifiable Information with protected health information subject to protection under HIPAA, the combined information will be treated as protected health information for as long as it remains combined.\n\nOther Information we may collect\n\u201cOther Information\u201d is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, including, for example: (1) computer or device connection information, such as browser type and version, operating system type and version, device information, and other

Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information for as long as it remains combined.\n\nSecurity Measures\nVirus Detection and E-mail Security:\u00a0For website security, we use software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.\u00a0 \nGeneral Practices: Although we seek to use reasonable measures to protect Personally Identifiable Information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that the information you provide to us through the Services\u00a0will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services.\nSecurity of Service Communications: Some communication through the Services may be sent through the standard HTTP protocol and may be delivered using regular e-mail. Information sent over HTTP is not encrypted. E-mail, while convenient, also poses several risks (e.g., e-mail is not a secure form of communication, is unreliable, can be forwarded, etc.). We cannot guarantee the security of the information sent through such means, nor can we guarantee that information you supply to us will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your computer and to take appropriate security measures to protect your information. We use encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your protected health information during data transport with My McLaren Chart.\nYour Obligations to Safeguard your Information: Security is not a one person job.

Any material changes to this Policy will become effective 7 days from when we post the revised Policy on the Services and all other changes to this Policy will become effective when we post the revised Policy on the Services.
