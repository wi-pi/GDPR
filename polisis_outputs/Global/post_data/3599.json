You can disable our cookies or all cookies through your browser setting, but please note that disabling cookies may impact some of our website\\'s features and prevent the site from operating properly.\\r\\r\\rA \"Web Beacon\" is an electronic image placed in the code of a webpage, application, or email. We use web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page to another and to improve site performance.\\r\\rFlash Cookies:\\r\\rWe may use or engage a third party that uses Local Stored Objects, sometimes referred to as \"Flash Cookies,\" and other technologies to collect and store information about the use of our services. A Flash cookie is a small data file placed on your computer or device using Adobe Flash technology. Flash cookies are different from the cookies discussed above because cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.

For example, we may collect information you submit to a blog, chat room, or social network. We also may collect information from other companies, organizations, or third-party partners. For example, we may receive information about you from a partner when we jointly offer services or from an advertiser about your experiences with them. By gathering additional information about you, we can correct inaccurate information and give you product recommendations and special offers more likely to interest you.\\r\\rHow We Use Your Information:\\rOur primary purpose in collecting information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your information in a variety of ways, including for the following purposes:\\rProduct and Service Fulfillment\\r\\rWe use your contact information to respond to your inquiries, fulfill your requests and improve your experience.\\r\\rOur Marketing Purposes\\r\\rWe use your information to deliver coupons, mobile coupons, newsletters, e-mails, mobile messages, and social media notifications about our brands, products, events or other promotional purposes.\\r\\rInternal Operations\\r\\rWe use your information to improve the effectiveness of our services, conduct research and analysis, or to perform other business activities as needed.\\r\\rPrevention of Fraud and other Harm\\r\\rWe use your information to detect, prevent or investigate potential security breaches, fraudulent transactions and monitor against theft.\\r\\rLegal Compliance\\r\\rWe may use your information to assist law enforcement and respond to regulatory or other legal inquiries.\\r\\rHow We Share Your Information:\\rWe do not sell, rent, or loan your personal information to any non-affiliated third parties, except as described in this Policy. We will only share your information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Walgreens as described below:\\rWhen We Work With Service Providers\\r\\rWe may share your information with affiliated and unaffiliated companies that perform tasks on our behalf related to our business. Such tasks include analyzing site usage data, customer service, electronic and postal mail service, and social and other media services. Third-party service providers only receive your information as necessary to perform their role, and we instruct them not to use your Information for any other purposes.\\rWe may work with other companies who place cookies, tags, and web beacons on our websites. These companies help operate our websites and provide you with additional products and services.\\rWe may also use third party advertising networks to serve advertisements on our behalf. The cookies received with the banner advertisements served by these networks may be used to collect and build behavioral profiles by these companies to deliver targeted advertisements on our website and unaffiliated websites.\\r\\rWhen We Work With Third Party Partners\\r\\rWe may work with other companies who operate their own websites or mobile applications, to allow them to offer Walgreens customers the ability to connect to Walgreens services. These services give you more options for ways to use Walgreens services from websites or apps that are not owned or operated by Walgreens.\\rWe contract with companies to allow Walgreens customers to access their Balance Rewards account from those partners\\' websites and/or mobile apps. This may include the ability to join Balance Rewards, add an existing Balance Rewards membership, and/or access your account balance.\\rBalance Rewards for healthy choices\u00ae members may choose to connect their accounts with third party apps and devices in order to earn points for their healthy activities. Notwithstanding the uses and disclosures set forth above, Walgreens will not use or disclose to third parties user data gathered under the Balance Rewards for  healthy choices\u00ae program for advertising or other use-based data mining purposes other than improving health, or for the purpose of health research. In no event will any information be collected from Balance Rewards for healthy choices\\xae members for use by third parties in compliance with this section without obtaining user consent.\\r\\rWhen  Sharing is Required by Law or Helps Us Protect Our Interests\\r\\rWe will use and disclose your information as necessary or appropriate under applicable law, to comply with legal process, to respond to such requests from public and government authorities, to enforce our terms and conditions, including investigations of potential violations, to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and to allow us to pursue available remedies to limit the damages that we may sustain.  In matters involving claims of personal or public safety or in litigation where the data is pertinent, we may use or disclose personal information without your consent or court process.\\r\\rWhen We Work On Business Transactions\\r\\rAs we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets, or as part of a merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions, or in the course of providing transition of services to another provider. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Additionally, in the unlikely event that Walgreens or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets and is permissible under law.\\r\\rNon-identifiable or Aggregate information with Third Parties\\r\\rWe may share non-identifiable or aggregate information with third parties for lawful purposes.\\r\\rWith Your Consent\\r\\rAt your direction or request, or when you otherwise consent, we may share your information.\\r\\rYour Choices:\\rBy interacting with any of the Walgreens Family of Companies as described above, you consent to the practices described in this privacy notice. However, we want you to know that you do have certain choices with regard to how your information is collected and used.\\rEmail and Mobile Communications\\r\\rYou may choose to stop receiving e-mail and mobile marketing communications by changing your preferences online. If you have an online account, login to Your Account and click on Communication Preferences. If you do not have an online account you may click Unsubscribe from the bottom of Walgreens emails, and reply STOP to our text messages to stop receiving emails and SMS text messages.

These third parties may collect information about your use of our services over time and that information may be combined with information collected on different websites and online services.\\rThese third party advertisers may be participants in the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising, which allow users to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies. To learn more about interest-based advertising, or to opt-out of having your web browsing information used by certain third party advertisers for behavioral advertising purposes, go to www.aboutads.info/choices or http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.\\rPlease Note: When you \"opt-out\" of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from Walgreens. It means that the online ads that you do see will not be tailored for you based on your particular interests. We may still collect information about you for any purpose permitted under the Policy, including for analytics and fraud prevention.\\r\\rOur \"Do Not Track\" Policy\\r\\rWalgreens respects enhanced user privacy controls. We support the development and implementation of a standard \"do not track\" browser feature, which signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Please note that at this time Walgreens.com does not interpret or respond to \"do not track\" signals. However, you may set your Web browser to not accept new cookies or web beacons, be notified when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. Please note that by disabling these features, your experience on Walgreens.com will not be as smooth and you will not be able to take full advantage of our website\\'s features. Please see the Help section of your browser for instructions on managing security preferences.\\r\\rMinors\\r\\rIf you are under 18 years old and a registered user, you can request that we remove content or information that you have posted to our website or other online services. Note that fulfilment of the request may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal (e.g., if the content or information has been reposted by another user). To request removal of content or information, please contact us.\\r\\rAccessing and Updating Your Personal Information\\r\\rYou can review and update any of the information you have given us by emailing us or calling (877) 924-4472. Our customer care staff will update your information. If you have a Walgreens.com account, you can log in and update your information.\\r\\rLinks to Third-Party Sites:\\rOur Services may contain links to, or otherwise make available, social media sites and other third party services, websites and mobile applications that are operated and controlled by third parties. We do not take responsibility for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.  Unless otherwise stated, any Information you provide to any such third party site will be collected by that party and not by Walgreens, and will be subject to that party\\'s privacy policy (if any), rather than this Privacy Notice. In such a situation, we will have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, that party\\'s use of the Information you provide to them.\\rLocation-Based Services:\\rWhen you download our mobile application, you can opt-in to location sharing for additional application capabilities.  If you have opted-in to sharing your location information, we may use various technologies to collect your information as described in this policy to provide you with location-based services and content, including for marketing purposes. For example, using the Store Locator feature in our mobile application can allow you to quickly find the nearest Walgreens location.  To learn how to opt-out of sharing your location information with Walgreens, go to the \"Your Choices\" section of this Privacy Policy.\\rHow We Protect Your Information:\\rSecurity Measures\\r\\rWalgreens recognizes the importance of maintaining the security of your personal information. Whether you are shopping on our website, through our mobile services, or in our stores, we use reasonable security measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards.\\r\\rEmail Security\\r\\r\"Phishing\" is a common email scam where your email address is used to contact you and ask for personal or sensitive information. Always be cautious when opening links or attachments from unsolicited third parties. Also know that Walgreens will not send you emails asking for your credit card number, social security number or other personally identifiable information. If you are ever asked for this information, you can be confident it is not from Walgreens.\\r\\rChildren\\'s Personal Information\\r\\rWe recognize the importance of protecting children\\'s online privacy. Our website and mobile services are intended for a general audience and are not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13.\\r\\r \\rHow To Contact Us:\\rIf you have questions about our Privacy Policy, contact us by:\\rPhone:  (877) 924-4472\\rE-mail: privacy.office@walgreens.com\\rRegular mail:\\rWalgreen Co.
