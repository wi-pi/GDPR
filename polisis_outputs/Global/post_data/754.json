About us\nThe British Museum was founded in 1753. Its aim is to hold for\nthe benefit and education of humanity a collection representative\nof world cultures (\u201cthe collection\u201d), and ensure that the\ncollection is housed in safety, conserved, curated, researched and\nexhibited.

Internal research and profiling\nWe carry out research and analysis on our visitors, Members and\nother supporters to determine the success of our public offer and\nprogrammes and other activities in the public interest and to help\nus provide you with a better experience (for example so that you\nonly receive communications about areas of our activities or\nresearch you are mostly likely to be interested in).\nWe may evaluate, categorise and profile your personal data in\norder to tailor materials, services and communications (including\ntargeted advertising) to your needs and your preferences and to\nhelp us to understand our audiences. For example, we may keep track\nof the amount, frequency and value of your support including your\nphilanthropic involvement elsewhere. This information helps us to\nensure communications are relevant, timely and in the best interest\nof our charitable purposes.\n5. Disclosing and sharing your personal data\nWe will never sell your personal data.\nIf you have opted-in to marketing, we may contact you with\ninformation about our selected partners. These communications will\nalways come from us and will usually be incorporated into our own\nmarketing.\nWe may share your personal data with contractors or suppliers\nwho provide us with services. For example, we may use a mailing\nhouse for the distribution of The British Museum Magazine; we use\nDirect Debit processors for the handling of payments and email\nproviders for our marketing communications. Information is\ntransferred to data processors securely, and we retain full\nresponsibility for your personal data as the data controller. These\nactivities are carried out under a contract which imposes strict\nrequirements on our suppliers to keep your personal data\nconfidential and secure.\nOccasionally, we arrange events with other organisations, for\nexample The American Friends of the British Museum, a tax exempt\norganization under section 501 (c) (3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue\nCode. We may share your personal data with such organisations, for\nexample where you register to attend events. We will only share\ninformation when necessary.\nWe may share your personal data where required to do so for\nprevention of crime or for taxation purposes (for example, with the\npolice, HMRC) or where otherwise required to do so by other\nregulators or by law (e.g. the Charity Commission, Companies\nHouse).\n6. Fundraising and marketing communications\n6.1. Consent\nUnless you have already given us your email address or telephone\nnumber so that we can tell you about making donations to us or\nabout the supply of goods and services, we must ask you to \u201copt-in\u201d\nto receive fundraising and marketing emails from us. You have the\nchoice as to whether you want to receive or continue to receive\nthese messages. You are also able to select how you want to receive\nthem (post, phone, email, text) and to change your preferences at\nany time.\nWhen you receive a communication from us, we may collect\ninformation about your response and this may affect how we\ncommunicate with you in future.\n6.2. Newsletters and magazines\nIf you are a Member or a Patron, we will send you the British\nMuseum Magazine (unless you specifically ask us not to) and you can\nchoose to unsubscribe from general marketing communications to\nMembers without cancelling your subscription to the British Museum\nMagazine.\n7.

Young Friends Membership\nMembership of the Museum is available to individuals aged 16 and\nover. Those aged between 8 and 14 can have a Young Friends\nMembership purchased for them by an adult.\nWhen a Young Friend reaches 16 and wishes to become a Member as\nan Under 26 adult, some of the personal data we hold about that\nindividual (e.g. Young Friend Membership history) will be carried\nover to their Member record.\n8. Data security\n8.1. Protection\nWe employ a variety of physical and technical measures to\nprotect information we hold and to prevent unauthorised access to,\nor use or disclosure of your personal data.\nElectronic data and databases are stored on secure computer\nsystems and we control who has access to information (using both\nphysical and electronic means). Staff receive data protection\ntraining and we maintain a set of data protection procedures which\nour staff are required to follow when handling personal data.\n8.2. Payment security\nAll electronic forms that ask you for your financial data will\nuse the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to encrypt the data\nbetween your browser and our servers.\nIf you use a payment card to donate, to buy Membership or to\npurchase something from us on-line, we will pass your payment card\ndetails securely to our payment provider. We comply with the\npayment card industry data security standard (PCI-DSS) published by\nthe PCI Security Standards Council.\n9. CCTV\nThe British Museum premises are protected by CCTV and you may be\nrecorded when you visit the Museum in Bloomsbury. We use CCTV to\nhelp provide a safe and secure environment for visitors, for our\nstaff and for the collection and to prevent or detect crime.\nThe system is managed in accordance with our standard operating\nprocedures and with good practice guidance issued by the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office. CCTV images will only be\naccessed by authorised security staff and are stored for up to 30\ndays, unless flagged for review.\n10. Storing your personal data\n10.1. Where we store data\nWe are wholly based in the UK and store data within the European\nEconomic Area. Some organisations which provide data processing\nservices to us do so under contract and may be based outside of the\nEEA. We will only allow them to do so if your data is adequately\nprotected.\n10.2. Retention of your personal data\nWe will only retain your personal data for as long as it is\nrequired for the purposes for which we collected it (e.g. we have a\ngenuine and legitimate reason and we\u2019re not harming any of your\nrights and interests).This will depend on our legal obligations and\nthe nature and type of information and the reason for which we\ncollected it. For example, should you ask us not to send you\nmarketing emails, we will stop storing your email address for\nmarketing purposes; however we will need to keep a record of your\npreference.\nWe continually review what information we hold and will delete\npersonal data which is no longer required.\n11. Control of your personal data\n11.1.
