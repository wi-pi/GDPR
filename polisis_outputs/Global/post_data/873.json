If you do not agree with any of the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not view, access or use the Services.

The IP address of your device is collected when you access the Services for the purposes of system administration, security, and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, our affiliates or vendors.  We do not combine IP addresses with any collected Personal Information, nor do we compile session activity reports by IP address. In addition, we currently do honor Do Not Track signals.\n        \nWhen you subscribe to any of our magazines or products, register for a newsletter, download our mobile apps, purchase an item, enter contests, contact us for any information or to ask a question, or participate in other on-line activities (e.g., surveys, providing comments, participating in social media or on-line games), you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information, which may include your name, street address, city, state, zip code, email address, and phone number (landline and/or mobile).   It is always your choice whether or not to provide us with such Personal Information.  However, if you do not provide the necessary information you may not be able to access some or all of the features of the Services. We also will have no way to respond to your questions or inquiries.\n\n            To summarize, the Personal Information we collect from you is meant to help us:\n            \u2022\tfulfil your order\n            \u2022\tmanage your registration preferences\n            \u2022\tsend you renewal notifications and/or service billing notifications\n            \u2022\tpersonalize web content (including social media) and advertising based on your personal characteristics or preferences\n            \u2022\tensure, as far as is practical, that our websites and applications are compatible with the browsers and operating systems used by most of our visitors\n            \u2022\tconduct customer satisfaction surveys\n\n\n            We may also:\n            \u2022\tinform you about additional products and services you may be interested in\n            \u2022\tinform you about other promotional activities we offer or from third parties with whom we have a business relationship\n            \u2022\tinvite you to participate in market research, surveys and polls for ourselves or for our client\n\nIn addition, when you purchase a gift subscription we will collect the recipient\u2019s name and email so we can send the gift subscription to the recipient.

This information may include, but not be limited to, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.   We use this information for profiling purposes, such as tracking user\u2019s web browsing activities through cookies or other tracking technologies, in order to analyze user browsing behavior to provide and to improve the Services and to serve online behavioral advertising.\nWe use cookies on our websites.  Cookies are used to improve functionality and your use of our websites, as well as for analytic and advertising purposes.  Disabling cookies may hinder your ability to access and use our websites or Services.    \nIn addition, we use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users\u2019 movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We use persistent cookies to assist us with the collection and use of de-identified browsing data, including IP address and Cookie ID to enable online behavioral advertising. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still navigate our websites, but your ability to use the Services may be limited. \nThis de-identified data includes, but is not limited to, information such as a web visitor\u2019s web pages which have been viewed by a web visitor, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third-party advertising technology vendor. As the Internet evolves, we may use different types of technologies to collect these types of de-identified, non-personally identifiable information. The collection of this de-identified data allows us and our partners to better target advertising to user interests. The data also allows us to provide improvements to our services, for example, improving the effectiveness of the advertisements delivered to users and limiting the number of times a person sees a given advertisement.  A further description of how we use online behavioral advertising is provided below.\nWe regularly conduct analytics activities on our websites and Services to determine their effectiveness and how they can be improved.  For example, we use Google Analytics and other services to improve our operations.

At any time, you can opt out at of this service by going to the following link sponsored by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA):  http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.

It means only that the advertising you do see will be less relevant to your interests and choices.\t    \n\n            Access to Your Personal Information; Information Choices\n            Residents of the EEA have the right to:\n            \u2022\tAccess your Personal Information;\n            \u2022\tDelete, or request deletion of, your Personal Information;\n            \u2022\tObject to or restrict processing of your Personal Information;\n            \u2022\tRequest portability of your Personal Information;\n            \u2022\tComplain to your local data protection authority at any time;\n            \u2022\tObject to automated decision making; and\n            \u2022\tUpdate your Personal Information.\n\n\n            To withdraw consent or exercise these rights, please:\n            \u2022\tContact us as provided below; or\n            \u2022\tAdjust your preferences through the Account preferences (if available).\n\n\n            Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.\n        \nIf we ask you to provide Personal Information to us to comply with a legal requirement or enter into a contract, we will inform you of this and let you know whether providing us with your Personal Information is required and if not, the consequences of not sharing your personal data with us.\nSimilarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our or a third party's legitimate interests and those interests are not already described above, we will let you know what those legitimate interests are.\nWe endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Policy.  We also take steps to minimize the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing sensitive or special categories of Personal Information about you. \nIf you are a Canadian resident, you may withdraw consent, request information about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information, and request information on our policies and practices relating to disclosure of information to our service providers.\nYou can also exercise these rights at any time by contacting us at privacy@theweek.com or as indicated below.

If you withdraw your consent you may no longer be able to access or use any of the Services.\nThird-Party Affiliates\n\n            We participate in affiliate marketing and may allow affiliate links to be encoded on some of our pages. This means that we may earn a commission if/when you click on or make purchases via affiliate links.\n        \nAccessing Your Information; Information Choices\n\n            In addition to any other rights to your data that you may have under laws that apply to you, you may access your Personal Information that we hold, and correct, amend, update or delete information that is inaccurate by contacting us at privacy@theweek.com.  We will respond to requests in accordance with the laws that apply to you and within a reasonable timeframe. You can help us maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any changes to your information.\n        \nHow to Opt-Out\n\n            To unsubscribe from a newsletter or any other electronic communications from us, reply to the email with \u201cUNSUBSCRIBE\u201d (and only \u201cUNSUBSCRIBE\u201d) in the subject line, or by following the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link at the bottom of the email or text.  Also follow the same procedure to unsubscribe to any promotional and marketing emails or texts from our partners.\n        \nSurveys, Promotions and Contests\n\n            We offer on-line surveys, promotions and contests reader surveys from time to time.  Participating in these on-line activities is entirely voluntary and without obligation, simply decline to participate by not clicking on the link that says \u201csurvey,\u201d etc.  However, if you do participate in these on-line activities, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information for the purposes of, for example, awarding you any prize or other benefit.\n        \nData Retention \n\n            We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you services that you request, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  \t    \nSecurity\n\n            We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information and to protect it against loss or unauthorized use or disclosure.   For example, our third-party payment processor uses industry-standard SSL protocol (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure that all credit card transactions are secure. \t    \nAs the Internet is not 100% secure, we cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. \nSale of Assets \n\n            In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets related to the business, we reserve the right to include, disclose and transfer any or all stored Personal Information and non-personal information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.  If The Week or our other assets are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information. \t    \nUsers Outside the United States\n\n            If we collect the Personal Information of residents from the European Economic Area (EEA), we advise that your Personal Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different than those in your country and may not be as protective.  The United States has not sought nor received a finding of \u201cadequacy\u201d from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR.  Our legal basis for collecting and using your Personal Information or information is to do so with your consent; where we need the Personal Information for performance of a contract, or where the collection and use is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect the Personal Information in question. If we collected your Personal Information with your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.\t    \nSocial Media Widgets\n\n            Our Services include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button, and similar features on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube that run on our websites. These features may collect your Internet protocol address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it. Our Services are not sponsored or endorsed by any of these third parties, nor do we sponsor or endorse them.\t    \nLinks to Other Sites; Transactions with Third Parties \nOur websites and Services may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us.

If you believe your child has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us at privacy@theweek.com\nYour California Privacy Rights; California Do Not Track Disclosures \nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83 (\u201cShine The Light\u201d Law) permits California residents to request information regarding the disclosure of your Personal Information to a third party for the third party's direct marketing purposes.  While we do make available Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing purposes, we also provide you with a mechanism to opt out of such disclosures.  Therefore, we are not required under the statute to provide users who are California residents with a list of third parties to whom your Personal Information may have been disclosed for direct marketing purposes.  \nChanges to This Privacy Policy\nWe reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check back periodically to confirm the most recent modification date to ensure that you are aware of any changes in our processing of your Personal Information.
