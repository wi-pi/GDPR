The promises in this Privacy Statement will apply to your Personal Information as transferred to the new entity.", "A note about aggregated data: Ancestry may disclose user information in an aggregated form as part of the Services or our marketing, or in scientific publications published by us or our research partners. For example, we might note the percentage of immigrants in a State that are from a particular geographic region or country. Such publications will never include Personal Information. 7.

If you require assistance deleting Personal Information you provided as part of your profile or subscription or from our blog or community forum, please submit a detailed deletion request (including the exact wording of the information as it appears on the websites, and the URL where that information is found) to our Member Services team. Please note however, if you have shared information through the Services (for example, by making your family trees public, or by sharing your DNA Results directly with other users), Ancestry will not be able to remove any copies of information that other Ancestry members may have retained. Additionally, Ancestry may hold records that contain your Personal Information that we are obligated to maintain as archives. Please direct any request to remove information from linked archival records to the responsible archival entity. We will consider requests for removal of Personal Information from the searchable indexes of the records we hold on a case-by-case basis and will endeavor to fully respect your requests to remove Personal Information. Additionally, some of your Personal Information may be included in other Ancestry members' family trees, which will only be removed if the other Ancestry member deletes it. Deletion of Genetic Information: If you request that Ancestry delete your DNA Data, we will delete all Genetic Information, including any derivative Genetic Information (ethnicity estimates, genetic relative matches, etc.) from our production, development, analytics, and research systems within 30 days. To request the destruction of your biological samples, you must contact Member Services. Please note that if you have agreed to our Informed Consent to Research, we will not be able to remove your Genetic Information from active or completed research projects, but we will not use it for any new research projects. Generally: All Ancestry data, including Personal Information, will persist in our backup systems after it has been deleted from our production, development, analytics, and research systems for up to 6 months before it is overwritten. Also, our laboratory partners may retain information they receive from us in order to comply with laws or regulations that may require them to do so, such as the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Ancestry may also retain certain information for tax and payment industry regulatory compliance purposes. 8. Security Ancestry maintains a comprehensive information security program designed to protect our customers' Personal Information using administrative, physical, and technical safeguards based on the sensitivity of the Personal Information collected. We have measures in place to protect against inappropriate access, loss, misuse, or alteration of Personal Information (including Genetic Information) under our control. Ancestry's Security Team regularly reviews our security and privacy practices and enhances them as necessary to help ensure the integrity of our systems and your Personal Information. We use secure server software to encrypt Personal Information (including Genetic Information), and we only partner with security companies that meet and commit to our security standards. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use reasonable efforts to prevent this. It is also important for you to guard against unauthorized access to your Personal Information by maintaining strong passwords and protecting against the unauthorized use of your own computer or device. 9. Data Transfer Any transfer of your Personal and Genetic Information, between Ancestry's U.S.-based company for processing in Ireland or Ancestry's Ireland-based company for processing in the United States, is conducted pursuant to established transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses. 10. Regulatory Compliance and Dispute Resolution We seek to resolve all privacy matters reported to us. However, if you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you can also contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) here. Users outside of the United States may contact the Irish Data Protection Commission, or your local Data Protection Authority. California's Shine the Light Law California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the \"Shine the Light\" law, permits Users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, Ancestry currently does not share any Personal Information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. Do-Not-Track Disclosure Ancestry notes that although we do our best to honor your privacy preferences, and have implemented industry standard safeguards as described above, we do not respond to Do-Not-Track signals from your browser at this time due to the lack of an established industry standard.

Also, when Ancestry uses other companies' services, data, and software tools to target advertising to you, these companies may collect information (such as a unique cookie or mobile identifier) about your online activities over time and across other websites or services on our behalf.

In particular, we will not share your Genetic Information with insurance companies, employers, or third-party marketers without your express consent. The circumstances described below explain when sharing might occur:\n\nOther Ancestry Members:  Any information you add to your Ancestry profile will be seen by other Ancestry members, as will public family tree details (we do not show living people in your tree to other users without your permission), and DNA matches (when you choose to see and be seen by your DNA matches).\nService Providers: We use the services of other companies to help us provide the Services to you. As a result, these partner companies will have some of your information in their systems. Our partners act only at the direction of Ancestry, and are subject to contractual obligations governing data security and confidentiality consistent with this Privacy Statement and applicable laws. These partners include our laboratory partners, DNA test shipping providers, credit card processors, cloud services infrastructure providers, biological sample storage facilities, and vendors that assist us in marketing, analytics, fraud prevention, and Member Support.\nResearch Partners: We share your Genetic Information with research partners only when you provide us with your express consent to do so through our Informed Consent to Research. By agreeing to the Informed Consent to Research you agree to the specified uses described in that document. Research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support scientific research or conduct or support the development of therapeutics, medical devices or related material to treat, diagnose or predict health conditions. In some circumstances, a research partner or Ancestry may have a financial interest in the research arrangement. A list of our research partners can be found here.\nFor Legal or Regulatory Process: We may share your Personal Information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:\n\t\nComply with valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas, warrants);\nEnforce or apply the Ancestry Terms and Conditions;\nProtect the security or integrity of the Services; or\nProtect the rights, property, or safety, of Ancestry, our employees or users.\n\nIf we are compelled to disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement, we will do our best to provide you with advance notice, unless we are prohibited under the law from doing so. In the interest of transparency, Ancestry produces a Transparency Report where we list the number of valid law enforcement requests for user data across all our sites.\n\nIf Ancestry is Acquired: In the event that Ancestry or its businesses are acquired or transferred to another entity (in whole or part and including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we will share your Personal Information with that entity. The promises in this Privacy Statement will apply to your Personal Information as transferred to the new entity.\n\nA note about aggregated data: Ancestry may disclose user information in an aggregated form as part of the Services or our marketing, or in scientific publications published by us or our research partners. For example, we might note the percentage of immigrants in a State that are from a particular geographic region or country. Such publications will never include Personal Information.\n\u00a0\n7.\u00a0\u00a0Your Choices and Access to Your Personal Information\nPrivacy Settings: You can access and update the Personal Information you provide to Ancestry at any time, such as your email address, username, profile information, etc. in the Profile, Account Options, Site Preferences, Email Preferences, Test Settings, and My Alerts sections.\n\u00a0\nAlso, to learn how to manage the privacy settings for any family trees you have created on Ancestry, please click here.\n\u00a0\nAncestry strives to make it simple for you to manage your privacy within the context of the Services. You can manage your privacy settings for our related brands by clicking on the following links:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAccess to the settings is also contained within Ancestry\u2019s mobile applications, such as the Ancestry, AncestryDNA or \u201cWe\u2019re Related\u201d apps.\n\u00a0\nIf you do not want us to use data about your interests or behaviors to serve you targeted ads, you may change your settings as described in our Cookie Policy.\n\u00a0\nFamily Tree Information Download: Ancestry allows you to download your family tree information in the standard GEDCOM family tree file format in your Family Tree Settings.\n\u00a0\nGenetic Information Download: Your DNA Data belongs to you. You always have the option of downloading a file with your DNA Data. Learn how here. For more information on what is included in your DNA Data download, go here.\n\u00a0\nDeletion: You can delete your Personal Information from Ancestry in a number of ways through the settings linked above. If you require assistance deleting Personal Information you provided as part of your profile or subscription or from our blog or community forum, please submit a detailed deletion request (including the exact wording of the information as it appears on the websites, and the URL where that information is found) to our Member Services team. Please note however, if you have shared information through the Services (for example, by making your family trees public, or by sharing your DNA Results directly with other users), Ancestry will not be able to remove any copies of information that other Ancestry members may have retained.\nAdditionally, Ancestry may hold records that contain your Personal Information that we are obligated to maintain as archives. Please direct any request to remove information from linked archival records to the responsible archival entity. We will consider requests for removal of Personal Information from the searchable indexes of the records we hold on a case-by-case basis and will endeavor to fully respect your requests to remove Personal Information. Additionally, some of your Personal Information may be included in other Ancestry members\u2019 family trees, which will only be removed if the other Ancestry member deletes it.\n\u00a0\nDeletion of Genetic Information: If you request that Ancestry delete your DNA Data, we will delete all Genetic Information, including any derivative Genetic Information (ethnicity estimates, genetic relative matches, etc.) from our production, development, analytics, and research systems within 30 days. To request the destruction of your biological samples, you must contact Member Services. Please note that if you have agreed to our Informed Consent to Research, we will not be able to remove your Genetic Information from active or completed research projects, but we will not use it for any new research projects.\n\u00a0\nGenerally: All Ancestry data, including Personal Information, will persist in our backup systems after it has been deleted from our production, development, analytics, and research systems for up to 6 months before it is overwritten. Also, our laboratory partners may retain information they receive from us in order to comply with laws or regulations that may require them to do so, such as the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Ancestry may also retain certain information for tax and payment industry regulatory compliance purposes.\n\u00a0\n8.\u00a0\u00a0Security\nAncestry maintains a comprehensive information security program designed to protect our customers\u2019 Personal Information using administrative, physical, and technical safeguards based on the sensitivity of the Personal Information collected. We have measures in place to protect against inappropriate access, loss, misuse, or alteration of Personal Information (including Genetic Information) under our control. Ancestry\u2019s Security Team regularly reviews our security and privacy practices and enhances them as necessary to help ensure the integrity of our systems and your Personal Information. We use secure server software to encrypt Personal Information (including Genetic Information), and we only partner with security companies that meet and commit to our security standards. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use reasonable efforts to prevent this. It is also important for you to guard against unauthorized access to your Personal Information by maintaining strong passwords and protecting against the unauthorized use of your own computer or device.\n\u00a0\n9.\u00a0\u00a0Data Transfer\nAny transfer of your Personal and Genetic Information, between Ancestry\u2019s U.S.-based company for processing in Ireland or Ancestry\u2019s Ireland-based company for processing in the United States, is conducted pursuant to established transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses.\n\u00a0\n10.\u00a0\u00a0Regulatory Compliance and Dispute Resolution\nWe seek to resolve all privacy matters reported to us. However, if you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you can also contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) here.\n\u00a0\nUsers outside of the United States may contact the Irish Data Protection Commission, or your local Data Protection Authority.\n\u00a0\nCalifornia\u2019s Shine the Light Law\n\u00a0\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the \u201cShine the Light\u201d law, permits Users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, Ancestry currently does not share any Personal Information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.\n\u00a0\nDo-Not-Track Disclosure\n\u00a0\nAncestry notes that although we do our best to honor your privacy preferences, and have implemented industry standard safeguards as described above, we do not respond to Do-Not-Track signals from your browser at this time due to the lack of an established industry standard. Ancestry uses advertising technology to show you advertising relevant to your Ancestry experience. Also, when Ancestry uses other companies\u2019 services, data, and software tools to target advertising to you, these companies may collect information (such as a unique cookie or mobile identifier) about your online activities over time and across other websites or services on our behalf. Controls to help you manage this type of tracking via advertising are detailed in our Cookie Policy.\n\u00a0\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement, our privacy practices, or wish to update, access or receive information about the Personal Information we maintain about you, you can contact us as follows:\n\u00a0\nAncestry members can reach us using these phone numbers, or you may submit questions using this web form.\n\u00a0\nOfficial correspondence must be sent via postal mail to:\nFor members located in the United States:\nAncestry.com Operations Inc.\nAttn: Privacy Office\n153 Townsend Street, Suite 800\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\n\u00a0\nFor members located outside of the United States:\nAncestry Ireland Unlimited Company\nAttn: Privacy Office\n52-55 Sir John Rogerson Quay\nDublin 2\nIreland\n\u00a0\n", "friendly_summaries": [["", ""], ["", ""], ["We collect data directly on our website.
