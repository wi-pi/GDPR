However, on occasions, we may need to collect personal information from other sources such as public records, parents or guardians of children under the age of 18 years and third parties.  When dealing with children, we seek parental consent prior to the collection of personal information, including photographs.\nWe may collect personal information in various ways, including via:\n\nOnline forms (such as subscription forms or registration forms for an event);\nSurveys (hard copy or online);\nInformation associated with accessing and using CSIRO websites;\nOver the telephone ;\nThe use of biometric technology;\nIn person in a meeting or interview scenario;\nVia emails or other correspondence sent to CSIRO;\nBy taking photographs or videos at CSIRO events;\nThird parties, for example reports from referees of prospective employees; or\nFrom publicly available information, such as interactions with CSIRO via social media sites.\n\nFor what purposes does CSIRO collect, hold and use personal information?\nWith CSIRO\u2019s extensive and diverse activities, we collect, hold and use personal information throughout CSIRO for many different purposes and via different methods.  We only collect personal information for purposes directly related to our functions or activities under the SIR Act and only where it is necessary for or directly related to such purposes. \nWhen we collect personal information from you for certain specific activities, where required, we will use a collection notice that deals specifically with that collection, including a description of the purposes for which we will use the personal information collected in that instance.  Where relevant, our internal procedures and systems embed privacy protections to ensure we comply with our obligations under the Privacy Act.\n We may use or hold personal information for the following general purposes:\n\nto provide scientific and research services to both public and private sector clients;\nto manage our employees and contractors, including to consider prospective employees;\nto undertake research and testing as part of our functions under the SIR Act (such as information about individuals participating in focus group testing, including health information for food testing and information about physical reactions to food additives);\nto maintain membership or subscriber records for our publications or club members (such as the Double Helix Club); and\nto promote and market our activities.\n\nFrom time to time, we may need to disclose personal information to our joint venture partners or share information with contractors or agents who provide services to us, such as off-site file storage facilities and financial institutions which transmit payments on our behalf.\nWe will collect personal information from you for the purposes described in a collection notice and will only use or disclose your personal information for other purposes if:\n\nyou have consented to the other use;\nyou would reasonably expect, or have been told, that your personal information is usually passed on to other entities;\nit is required or authorised by law;\nit will prevent or lessen a serious threat to someone\u2019s life, health or safety (including public health and safety);\nrequired to take appropriate action in relation to suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct;\nrequired to locate a missing person; or\nrequired to assert a legal or equitable claim or to conduct an alternative dispute resolution process.\n\nSet out below is some further detail of how we may use personal information collected for certain of our main activities.\nVisiting the CSIRO website\nWhen visiting www.csiro.au, a record of your visit is logged. The following information, supplied by your browser, is recorded for statistical purposes to help improve the CSIRO website:\n\nuser's server address (IP address)\nuser\u2019s internet service provider (ISP)\nuser's operating system (for example Windows, Mac etc)\nuser's top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc)\ndate and time of the visit to the site\npages accessed and the documents downloaded\nprevious site visited if you visited from a hyperlink to our website via another web page\nexit link\nscreen resolution\ntype of browser used.\n\nNo attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except in the unlikely event of an investigation required by law where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Internet Service Provider's logs.\nWe will not release your personal information collected via the CSIRO website to any person unless the law requires or permits it or your permission is given. We provide a secure environment and a reliable system but you should be aware that there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to use the Internet, we provide alternative ways of obtaining and providing information; e.g. by contacting CSIRO Enquiries by phone or e-mail. \nEmailing CSIRO\nWhen you send an e-mail to a CSIRO address (name@csiro.au), the content and your details, including your e-mail address, become part of our records.  Your e-mail address, acquired in this way, will not be added to any mailing list unless specified in a collection statement or unless we obtain your consent.\nCompleting an online form\nShould you decide to complete and submit an online form on any part of the CSIRO website, we:\n\nmay record personal details provided by you such as; e-mail address, street address, telephone number, occupation, company, areas of interest etc to the extent they are relevant to the purpose for which we are collecting them.\nwill only used this information for the purpose for which it was collected.\nwill not disclose this information without your consent except where CSIRO may be required by law to disclose the information.\n\nResearch activities\nWe may conduct research involving human participants and this research may involve the collection of personal information, including health information, genetic information, or information about a person as part of social research.  The collection of such information may also have ethical approval requirements.\nWhen dealing with personal information in a research context, we will usually de-identify that information.  If personal information is not de-identified, we will deal with personal information collected in the course of research in accordance with the Privacy Act.\nWe may also deal with personal information of research partners or clients when providing scientific research services and testing services to both public and private sector clients.  This may include the following sorts of personal information:\n\nName, address, occupation and residential email and telephone contact details;\nOpinions and reactions to testing and research; or\nHealth information.\nClient information;\ncredit card or other personal financial details. \n\nIf we collect your personal information as part of our research activities, we will use that information for the purposes of the specific research activity and we may also add it to a database for the purpose of contacting you about future CSIRO activities, but only where you would reasonably expect this or have consented.\nCSIRO Enquiries service\nWhen you contact us for general information about our activities or about science and technology generally, we will:\n\nLog the contact (online or otherwise) in a secure database;\nRecord your name and other contact details, and information about the nature of the enquiry and response provided;\nRecord phone calls for the purpose of quality assurance and coaching;\nNot add you to a mailing list, but may seek consent to contact you to provide feedback on the service provided.\nNot disclose the information collected without your consent except where CSIRO may be required by law to disclose the information.\n\nDirect communication from CSIRO\nWe store the contact details of a wide range of clients and stakeholders, ranging from direct subscribers to periodical publications, to business, research and community contacts.

Alternatively, unsubscribe requests can be made directly to CSIRO Enquiries.\n\nManaging our personnel and other support services functions\nCSIRO will collect personal information from prospective employees for the purposes of administering a recruitment process.  Unlike the private sector, CSIRO\u2019s employee records are subject to the Privacy Act and we use the personal information of CSIRO staff for the purposes of administering their employment with CSIRO.  This may include using and disclosing personal information for:\n\ngeneral management of employment;\nperformance management (misconduct, grievance, probation);\nfinancial, legal, security, information technology and communications matters related to a staff member\u2019s employment.\n\nEngaging with the public about science\nWe collect personal information in the course of promoting and marketing our activities to the public, including via the following:\n\nPromotions / competitions;\nPhotographs of individuals taken at CSIRO events;\nCollecting data about the public\u2019s opinions on science (e.g. feedback via social media);\nSending marketing material to clients;\nmaintaining membership or subscriber records for our publications or club members (such as the Double Helix Club);\nCSIRO Education programs and publications. \n\nFreedom of Information requests\nWe collect personal information when administering an individual\u2019s request for access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1984 (Cth).\nCSIRO as a contracted service provider to other Commonwealth agencies\nWe may, from time to time, engage service providers to provide services to us.  Where those services involve a service provider dealing with personal information on our behalf, we will ensure that our contract with the service provider obliges the service provider to comply with the same level privacy obligations as CSIRO.\nHow does CSIRO store personal information?\nEach area of CSIRO that collects personal information stores that information securely on CSIRO\u2019s  IT systems.  These systems are password protected and where required, only certain people are authorised to access the information.  We also have recordkeeping obligations under the Archives Act 1983 (Cth), and have record keeping codes specific to particular areas of CSIRO activity.  We are also required to comply with other government policies in relation to storage and security of information, including the Australian Government Policy and Risk Management Guidelines for the storage and processing of Australian Government information in outsourced or offshore ICT arrangements and theProtective Security Policy Framework, complemented by the Australian Government Information Security Manual.\nWe may use third parties to store some personal information on servers in Australia or overseas, but only where steps have been taken to ensure that the third parties comply with our privacy obligations.\nDisclosures of personal information overseas\nWe may disclose personal information overseas from time to time, for example in the course of a research project with an overseas entity, through publishing information or by storing information on a server located overseas.  Where we may be transferring personal information overseas, we will either inform you and seek your consent to the arrangement or ensure that appropriate contractual measures are in place to ensure that the overseas entity protects the personal information to the same level as required of CSIRO under the Privacy Act.\nAccess to and amendment of personal information held by CSIRO\nWe will provide you with access to your personal information that we hold, subject to any applicable exceptions under the Privacy Act. We will require you to verify your identity and specify, as clearly as possible, the information that you wish to access.  We will not charge you for lodging a request for access to your own personal information but may charge for reasonable administrative costs. The fee will be determined on a case by case basis and you will be informed beforehand of the likely cost.\nCSIRO employees seeking their employment details should initially do so in accordance with CSIRO\u2019s human resources processes. CSIRO is also subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1984 (Cth) and this operates alongside your right to access your personal information under the Privacy ACT.\nIf you can establish that information held by us about you is inaccurate, irrelevant, out of date, incomplete or misleading, we will take reasonable steps to amend it.   If we disagree with your view about the status of this information, we will provide reasons for the refusal and record a statement in our records of your view.\nComplaints\nIf you have a privacy related complaint about us, please contact CSIRO\u2019s Privacy Officer on (02)\u00a06276\u00a06123 or FOI@csiro.au.\n\n", "friendly_summaries": [["", "We have a special section in the policy on how we handle the data of users from California."], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle children's data.", ""], ["We share data with third parties.
