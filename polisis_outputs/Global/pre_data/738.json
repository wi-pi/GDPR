Alternatively, if you\u2019d prefer not to contact us, you may be able to do it yourself depending on the nature of your request. For example:\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nYou can update the details we hold about you by logging into your booking via the \u201cManage your booking\u201d tab on our site and following the instructions to edit your details, or contact us to change details of your booking; and\n\t\u00a0\nIf you wish to remove your information from our marketing circulation lists, which include receiving marketing emails, you can unsubscribe by scrolling to the bottom of the email and clicking the \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 link.\n\t\u00a0\nWe will comply with your requests unless we have a lawful reason not to do so.\u00a0\n\n\n10.4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0What we need from you to process your requests\n\nPlease be aware that we may need you to provide additional information (such as to confirm your identity and/or to confirm what information you wish to access) in order to process your request.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n11.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0WHERE IS YOUR INFORMATION?\u00a0\n11.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Our service providers and suppliers\nWe are based within the European Economic Area (EEA). However, in certain circumstances information that we collect about you will be sent to and held by us in countries outside of the EEA where we work with suppliers and service providers that are either based outside of the EEA or have servers based outside of the EEA. Countries outside of the EEA protect information differently, and so where we do transfer your information to suppliers based outside of the EEA, we will take all steps necessary to ensure that it is adequately protected and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to relying on any appropriate cross-border transfer solutions such as the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.\nA list of the countries outside of the EEA to which we may transfer your personal information is available here.\n\n11.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Destination territories\nAs we outline above, in certain circumstances, we are required to share information about you with immigration or other government authorities before we can deliver you to your destination.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n12.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HOW WE LOOK AFTER YOUR INFORMATION\n12.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Our security measures\nWe strive to constantly keep our security practices under review to make sure that we\u2019re keeping your information as safe as possible. We use a variety of different technical and operational security measures to protect your information against unauthorised access or unlawful use. For example we:\u00a0\n\nEnsure the physical security of our offices, warehouses and other sites;\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nEnsure the physical and digital security of our equipment, devices and systems by mandating appropriate password protection, encryption and access restrictions;\n\t\u00a0\nAre a \u201cPCI DSS\u201d compliant company, meaning that we apply certain high standards of security in respect of your payment information;\n\t\u00a0\nEnsure appropriate access controls so that access to your information is only granted to those of our people that need to use it in the course of their work;\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nCarry out regular penetration testing of our systems and third party reviews of our software; and\n\t\u00a0\nMaintain internal policies and deliver data protection and confidentiality training to make sure our people also understand their responsibilities in looking after your information and commit to taking appropriate measures to enforce these responsibilities.\u00a0\n\n12.2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0How you can help ensure the security of your information\u00a0\nYou can also play a part in helping to keep your information safe. Here are a few useful starting points:\n\nChoose strong passwords and change them regularly;\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nKeep your booking references and passwords confidential, and avoid sharing them with anyone else or using your password for multiple accounts;\n\t\u00a0\nLog out of \u201cManage my booking\u201d after each session if you are using a shared computer;\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nInform us immediately if you know or suspect that your password or booking reference has been compromised or if someone may have accessed your account;\n\t\u00a0\nKeep your devices protected by ensuring that you\u2019re using the latest version of your operating system and have suitable anti-virus software, if applicable; and\n\t\u00a0\nBe alert to any fraudulent emails that may appear to be from us, but aren\u2019t. Any emails that we send will come from [*]@virginholidays.com.\n\n12.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Links to other sites and resources\nOur site contains content and links to other sites that are operated by third parties (including the Virgin Travel Group and / or any other third parties whom we believe you may be interested in). Please note that we do not control these third party sites or the cookies that such third parties operate and this Privacy Policy will not apply to them. Be sure to consult the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of the relevant third party site to understand how that site collects and uses your information and to establish whether and for what purposes they use cookies.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n13.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR\nWe keep your information for as long as is reasonably necessary to enable us to provide you with the services that you have requested from us, to comply with any legal obligations that require us to keep information, or for as long as we reasonably require for our legitimate interests, including for example for the purposes of exercising our legal rights or defending ourselves against claims. We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold and the length of time that we need to keep it. For example:\u00a0\n\nWe try to adopt a paperless approach wherever possible and securely destroy any paper correspondence we receive on a regular basis unless we are required to retain it for evidential or legal purposes;\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nWe retain a suppression list of individuals who no longer wish to be contacted by us indefinitely. We need to keep this information to comply with their wishes not to contact them;\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nWe retain any unsuccessful CV\u2019s or job applications that we receive for a period of up to 2 years in case we think you might be suited to another opportunity that becomes available in the near future;\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n14.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0COMPLAINTS\n14.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Not happy?\u00a0\nIf you have any comments, questions or concerns about the contents of this Privacy Policy or the way in which we use your information, we encourage you to contact us using the details in the \u201cABOUT US\u201d section above to see if we can help resolve the issue in the first instance.\u00a0\nHowever, if you\u2019d still like to make a formal complaint or have concerns regarding the ways in which we use your information, you can contact the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (also known as the \u201cICO\u201d). The ICO is an independent authority and the UK\u2019s supervisory authority for information rights.\u00a0\nYou can register your concerns on the ICO site by clicking here.\u00a0\n\nLAST UPDATED: 22 February 2018\u00a0\n", "friendly_summaries": [[""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], [""], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle the data of citizens of other countries."], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle the data of citizens of other countries."], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle the data of citizens of other countries."], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle the data of citizens of other countries."], ["We have a special section in the policy on how we handle the data of citizens of other countries."], ["We collect data directly on our website.
