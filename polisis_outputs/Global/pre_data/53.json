retail stores, our Web Sites, and all other channels in which Best Buy collects and uses your personal information.At Best Buy we know how important it is to protect your personal information. Whether you are shopping with us online or in person we want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.What we collect\nAt Best Buy, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information. The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us.\nYour Consent\nBest Buy will collect, use, or disclose your personal information only with your knowledge and consent, except where required or permitted by law. When you choose to provide us with your personal information you consent to the use of your personal information as identified in this Privacy Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection.\nPersonal information\nPersonal information is information that can identify an individual or information about an identifiable individual. We may collect personal information such as:\n\nyour contact information - e.g., name, postal address, telephone number, and email address;\nyour personal preferences - e.g., product wish lists, language preferences, and marketing consent; and your transaction information - e.g., products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, and credit or debit card number.\n\nNon-personal information\n\nNon-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example:\n\nwe may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our flyer distribution;\nwe may collect certain non-personal data when you visit our Web Sites, such as the type of browser you are using or the referring URL; or\nwe may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that a certain percentage of contest entrants are male, aged 18 to 25.\n\nAll references to \"Web Sites\" in this Privacy Policy mean www.bestbuy.ca, www.geeksquad.ca, or other Best Buy provided Web sites.\nYou may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you a Best Buy credit card if you have provided us with certain financial information.\nSupplementing Information\nFrom time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information you have provided us. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide better service.\nTop\u2191\nHow we collect information\nCollected from you\nListed here are some further examples of the ways that we collect personal information directly from you and how we use it.\n\nIn-Store Purchases\nWhen you purchase a Best Buy product or service, you may need to provide us with contact and payment information (such as credit card information) so that we can process your request or complete your transaction. Examples where we need contact information include delivery services, product servicing, in-home installations, and extended warranty coverage. We also may use your contact information to send you promotional information.\nReturns and Exchanges\nOur goal is to ensure that you are completely satisfied with your purchase and to this end, Best Buy offers a Return Policy. For Best Buy to continue to offer our Return Policy, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, and telephone number for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud. You may also be asked to produce photo ID for verification purposes only.\nApplying for the Best Buy Credit Card\nWhen you apply for a Best Buy credit card, certain contact and financial information is collected and reviewed by our credit card provider, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Caisses Desjardins du Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cDesjardins\u201d), to approve, establish and maintain credit card accounts. Desjardins has its own privacy policy, available at https://www.desjardins.com/ca/privacy/ which governs its relationship with you. We also encourage you to read their privacy statement provided with your credit card application.\nReClaim Insurance Replacement\nWhen working with our ReClaim Consultants to replace goods that are covered under your insurance policy, we will need some basic information, such as your contact information, insurance claim number, and the name of your claim adjuster, so we can process your quote in a timely manner and bill your insurance company directly for you.\nPurchase Follow-Up and Surveys\nFollowing a purchase from some of our departments we may send you a follow-up letter to thank you for your business, or we may contact you to ensure that you are completely satisfied with the delivery, setup, or installation of your new product.\nWe may use contact information collected in-store, online, or via our call centres to conduct occasional surveys and other customer research. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.\nOur Web Sites\nOur Web Sites can be browsed anonymously. We use your browsing history and personal information to display interest-based advertising that is relevant to you. We place interest-based advertisements on our website as well as other third-party sites. The browsing history we use is collected by us and by third parties on our website. We may also share your anonymous browsing history from our website with third parties to provide relevant ads. They may combine this information with assumptions based on the other websites you have visited in order to tailor ads to you.\nTo engage in certain special features or functions of our Web Sites, or to order products and services from our Web Sites, you may be asked to provide certain personal information, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, or credit card information. We use this information to create your account, contact and correspond with you about your order, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions of our Web Sites that you choose to use, such as Customer Reviews.\nIf you choose to ship an order to a third party, you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from the third party to permit Best Buy to collect, use, and disclose the third party\u2019s personal information for the purposes of fraud prevention and processing and shipping the order.\u00a0\nCustomer Reviews\nThe Customer Review functionality is provided as a rating system that offers you the chance to share your thoughts on a product. These reviews are accessible to all Web Site visitors so please use discretion when posting information to them and do not post personal information.\nSign-Up for Newsletters or Updates\nBest Buy offers a variety of newsletters and promotional communications. You may choose to stop receiving these communications at any time. Each marketing or promotional email we send to you will include a link or other method to quickly and easily unsubscribe and decline further similar emails. You may also use the unsubscribe link included below under the heading \"Unsubscribe.\u201d\nParticipate in a Contest or Promotion\nFrom time to time, we may run contests or promotions. If you participate, you may be asked for contact information as well as additional optional survey information (for example, product preferences). Personal information from contest entries will be used only to administer the contest and contact you if you win. For research and analysis purposes, we may also summarize contest survey information in a manner that no longer identifies individual participants. All contests and promotions are subject to this Privacy Policy and the rules that will be available with each particular campaign. Some contests are conducted by third parties and will be subject to the third party\u2019s policies.\nEmail a Friend\nWhile visiting our Web Sites you may choose to use the \"Email a Friend\" tool which allows you to inform a friend about products of interest to you. The information you provide will be used to send a one-time email to your friend, inviting them to our Web Sites. We will not add your friend to a mailing list and will not send them further email unless they choose to receive such communications from us. When using the \"Email a Friend\" tool you are contacting your friend directly and as such you acknowledge that you are responsible for this correspondence and not Best Buy. If you provide us with personal information concerning another individual (e.g., email address), you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from that individual to enable us to use that personal information for the identified purpose.\nSubscription Services and Activations\nBest Buy may offer activation of certain products and services like cellular plans, satellite services, or Internet services. These activations may require that certain contact and financial information be collected and provided to the respective service providers as part of the activation process. For example, a cellular carrier may need to perform a credit check prior to activation so a government-issued ID number and your credit card number may be provided to the carrier for that purpose.\nCall Centres\nBest Buy operates customer support call centres to accept and address your questions, concerns, or complaints. When you contact our call centres, we may ask for personal information to help us respond to your inquiry or to verify your identity. For example if you have a question about the status of a recent online order, we will ask for personal information to verify that you are the account holder. We may also monitor or record your telephone discussions with our customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service quality.\n\nCollected automatically\nIn some cases, we automatically collect certain information.\n\nOur Web Sites\nWhen using our Web Sites, we may collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access our Web Sites, the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our Web Site, the operating system you are using, the sections of the Web Site you visit, the Web Site pages read and images viewed, and the content you download from the Web Site. This information is used for Web Site and system administration purposes and to improve the Web Sites.\nCookies\nThe Web Site uses \"cookies\", a technology that installs a small amount of information on a Web Site user's computer to permit the Web Site to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Web Site. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Web Site (so you do not have to enter your language preference every time), to offer personalized Web page content and information for your use, to track your activity at the Web Site, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise facilitate your Web Site experience. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Web Site and your ability to access certain features of the Web Site or engage in transactions through the Web Site.\nWeb Site Tracking Information\nWe may use web beacons or pixel tags to compile tracking information reports regarding Web Site user demographics, Web Site traffic patterns, and Web Site purchases. We may then provide these reports to advertisers and others. None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities or other personal information of individual users. For our own research purposes we may link tracking information with personal information voluntarily provided by Web Site users. Once such a link is made, all of the linked information is treated as personal information and will be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nLinks to Other Web Sites\nOur Web Site may contain links to other Web sites or Internet resources which are provided solely for your convenience and information. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another Web site or Internet resource. Best Buy has no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other Web sites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

We have retention standards that meet these parameters. We destroy your information when it is no longer needed, or we remove your personally identifiable information to render it anonymous.\nTop\u2191\n\u00a0\nHow we share your information\nBest Buy does not sell or rent our customers\u2019 personal information to any other party. However, in the normal course of business we may share some of your personal information within our corporate family and with third parties acting on our behalf or as permitted or required by law.\nSome of these operations may result in personal information collected by Best Buy being stored or processed outside of Canada and, as a result, your personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in accordance with the law of these foreign jurisdictions.\n\nService Providers\nBest Buy may use third parties to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handing of personal information. When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that your personal information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nFor example, we may share personal information with third parties to perform services on our behalf such as: fulfilling online orders, processing non-cash payments, sending marketing communications, servicing products, conducting research surveys, verifying and validating information that you have provided to us, delivering products, and providing customer support services.\nBest Buy has taken precautions to prevent the fraudulent use of your information on our Web Sites.
