Board of Pediatrics (\u201cABP,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d).\u00a0 We are committed to respecting your privacy and to protecting any information you provide to us.\nThe purpose of this Privacy Policy is to describe what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, \u00a0and why it is shared with third parties.\u00a0 Our goal in establishing this Privacy Policy is to assure you that information disclosed to us is handled appropriately regarding the privacy of this information.\nAs a convenience, we may provide links to third party websites that may solicit information from you.\u00a0 We do not control, nor are we responsible for, the privacy policies or practices of any other website.\nPlease note that your use of our website is also subject to our Terms of Use.\nInformation We May Collect\nPersonal Information:\u00a0 We require that physicians provide certain personally identifiable information, including name, mailing address, email address, phone number, date of birth, government-issued identification numbers, education, and professional background information (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d). We use this Personal Information to identify and communicate with physicians, as well as to determine their eligibility and qualification to become a candidate for certification or to maintain their certification. By providing data, including Personal Information, to us, whether through registrations, surveys, forms, or otherwise, physicians consent to our use of their data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\u00a0 \u00a0Physicians may make limited changes to their Personal Information at any time by visiting our website, clicking the \u201cLog In\u201d button at the top right corner, and accessing the \u201cPortfolio Landing\u201d page.\nTraining Information:\u00a0 We require that program directors and program coordinators provide certain Personal Information, including name, mailing address, email address, and title.\u00a0 In addition, program directors and program coordinators provide Personal Information which includes date of birth and government-issued identification numbers, training qualifications, participation in activities, and credentialing information of residents and fellows within their training programs.\u00a0 We use this information to track residents\u2019 and fellows\u2019 training, administer in-training examinations, grant access and award credit for activities completed by residents, and credential residents and fellows for certification examinations.\u00a0 Program directors and program coordinators may make changes to their Personal Information at any time by visiting the Program Portal through the ABP website, then accessing the \u201cManage Profiles\u201d page.\nSurvey Information: \u00a0We may include brief surveys during the examination application process, enrollment into the Maintenance of Certification program, and at the end of some exams. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, we may survey diplomates directly concerning specific topics. \u00a0This information is used for our internal business purposes, to inform and improve our programs, and also to anticipate trends in the pediatric workforce.\u00a0\nFinancial Information:\u00a0 When physicians pay an examination fee or Maintenance of Certification enrollment fee via our website or when program directors or program coordinators pay for in-training examinations given by their programs, certain financial information, such as credit card numbers, credit card expiration dates, and billing addresses, are used to charge the physician or the program.\u00a0 Credit card information is passed to our credit card processing vendor, and the credit card number, security code, and expiration date are not retained by us.\u00a0\nAnonymous Information:\u00a0 As individuals navigate through our website, we may collect and store anonymous information about them using various technologies such as cookies, Internet tags, advertising pixels, and navigational data.\u00a0 \u201cCookies\u201d are tiny alphanumeric identifiers that are stored on your computer and allow us to adjust the website to meet your personal browsing preferences.\u00a0 If the browser is set to refuse cookies, access to the private, secured section of our website will not be provided. \u00a0\u00a0Google Analytics is also used to collect information about the website, such as how often users visit the website, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website. To learn more about how Google collects and uses data when you visit the website, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.\u00a0 Every time a site user requests or downloads a file from www.abp.org, we may store the IP address and data about these events in a log file.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We may use the information from Google Analytics and log files to analyze trends to improve the usability of the website, to ensure established performance levels of our website are achieved, to resolve a user\u2019s problems by tracing historical movements, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use or for other business purposes.\nHow Information is Used in Internal Business Purposes\nThe ABP makes information available to its employees, appointees, and contractors for internal business purposes such as to track training of residents and fellows, credential physicians for initial certification and maintenance of certification, conduct the registration, administration, and scoring of examinations,\u00a0 and to offer and record completion of certification and maintenance of certification activities approved by the ABP.\nRelease of Certification Status: We consider a physician\u2019s certification status, including the current status of the physician\u2019s participation in the ABP\u2019s \u201cMaintenance of Certification\u201d program and the physician\u2019s certification history, to be public information. We may publish on our website a physician\u2019s current and historical certification status, and we may disclose this information to third parties. \u00a0\nRelease of Information to Third Parties for Internal Business Purposes:\u00a0 We generally regard all other information about individuals as private and confidential, and will therefore typically use it only for our internal business purposes. However, we may disclose certain information in certain circumstances, including the following:\n1. Diplomate Data\nWe share information regarding a diplomate's certification status, Personal Information, and educational information with the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), which publishes The Official ABMS Directory of Board Certified Medical Specialists; medical societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, which publishes the journal Pediatrics, to help maintain the currency and accuracy of diplomate records, to provide Continuing Medical Education credit for activities created by the ABP, and to provide materials to diplomates that are designed to assist them in remaining current in their specialty; the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB), to help maintain the currency and accuracy of diplomate records and to publish the FSMB Physician Profile; Data Commons, which enables data transfers, to provide ABP-released data exchange among approved third parties; and with other third parties we determine to be reasonable and in the interest of the ABP to fulfill its mission and purposes.\n2. Aggregate Data\nWe regard the results of an individual physician's examination, ABP-approved activity performance, and survey responses as private. We may, however, make available the aggregate results of various groups (eg, residents) at our discretion. We publish examination pass rates, training program pass rates, and workforce data on our website to inform the broader pediatric community. In these instances, however, we will endeavor not to identify specific physicians; only aggregated results will be disclosed.\n3. Resident/Fellow Summary Evaluation Data\nWe release information regarding summary evaluations obtained through the resident and fellow tracking system, including dates of training, credit provided for that training, final evaluation and In-Training exam scores, upon the request of a trainee/diplomate with a notarized signature or the request of a training program that has accepted or is considering accepting a resident/fellow in transfer, or when we become aware that a resident/fellow has entered a new training program, either through the tracking and evaluation system transfer form or through other means of communication. We also provide residency/fellowship training directors the examination results of their residents/fellows on their in-training and certifying examinations.\u00a0\n4. Additional Data\nFor joint board certifications where we are not the administrating Board, we release information necessary for the administrating board to permit the physician to sit for the examination. We release data to third parties in order to deliver examinations. We also release minimal data to outside organizations that provide ABP-approved self-assessments, Quality Improvement projects, Performance Improvement Modules (PIMs), or other activities in order for our residents, fellows, and diplomates to access those modules.\n5. Electronic Communications\nWe may use third party companies to deliver electronic communications. We will enter into commercially reasonable confidentiality agreements with these third parties to safeguard the information they transmit on our behalf.\nRelease of Information to Internal Research Staff and/or Third Parties for Research Purposes:\u00a0 The ABP may disclose certain information in certain circumstances for research purposes, including but not limited to the following examples:\u00a0 Dissemination of ABP efforts to improve its programs, and elucidation of factors influencing workforce trends.\u00a0\nConditional Release of Information\n1. Misconduct\nWe reserve the right to disclose, and typically will disclose, information in our possession to appropriate investigators or entities (eg, state medical boards, other credentialing bodies) and may make public information regarding any individual whom the ABP, in ours sole and absolute discretion, suspects or determines has: (i) violated our rules, policies, procedures, or required competencies (eg, codes of ethical behavior); (ii) engaged in misrepresentation or unprofessional behavior; (iii) had his/her diplomate status revoked or been otherwise disciplined; or (iv) demonstrated signs of impairment.\n2. Court Order\nWe will disclose all relevant information in our possession for which we do not have a claim of legal privilege in response to a lawful subpoena, court order, or an authorized request by a government or regulatory entity.\n3. Consent\nWe will release information not otherwise disclosed pursuant to this Privacy Policy to third parties upon the direction of and receipt of a signed authorization from the physician for whom the information pertains.\n4. Other\nWe may respond to research requests from individuals or organizations on a case-by-case basis. Other than as identified herein, we ordinarily do not disclose physician information to third parties, including contact information for marketing or outreach purposes.\u00a0 In the event we must disclose information in other circumstances, a reasonable effort will be made to notify the physician whose information is sought.\u00a0 If we transfer all or a portion of its operations or assets to another organization, we would contractually require the recipient to treat the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nProtection of Your Information\nWe have put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information that we collect.\u00a0 In 2014, the ABP established a Privacy Management Program, which is a comprehensive, organization-wide program describing the philosophical and practical process for how we address the collection, use, retention, disposal, sharing, and protection practices of personally identifiable information within the organization and define the security policies and practices that are taken to safe-guard that information. \u00a0However, no security system is perfect.\u00a0 Thus we cannot guarantee that information transmitted to us over the Internet will not be intercepted and therefore may not remain private.\nCredit card processing activities and related technologies must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).\u00a0 We undergo regularly scheduled audits by an independent security firm to ensure our compliance with the PCI-DSS and other security standards.\u00a0 We will not otherwise share an individual\u2019s financial information with third parties for any other purpose except as required by law (such as complying with a subpoena or court order).\nUse of Website by Children\nThe website is not intended for children under the age of 13.\u00a0 We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via the website from visitors in this age group and will take prompt steps to delete any such personally identifiable information.\nChanges to This Privacy Policy\nWe reserve the right to periodically update or change this Privacy Policy. Our posting of an update to this Privacy Policy on our website will serve as notice of that update. The updated statement (along with its effective date) may be viewed by visiting our website and selecting the \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d link at the bottom of the home page.\nTransfer of Information across International Boundaries\nWhen visiting our website from a country other than the United States, or while in the United States but connected to an overseas virtual protocol network (VPN), electronic communication will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting our website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to these transfers.\nTracking\nAt this time, our website does not respond to web browser \u201cdo not track\u201d signals.\u00a0 We may add this functionality in the future, and if we do, this Privacy Policy will be updated and a notice will be placed on the website.\u00a0 For now, third parties may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our website.\nFor California Users Only\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires certain businesses to disclose, upon a written request, (i) a list of the kinds of personal information that the business has disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, and (ii) the names and addresses of all of the third parties that received personal information from the business for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.\u00a0 Businesses must respond to such requests within 30 days, but they are only obligated to respond to one request from a customer in a calendar year.\nIf you live in California, you may request this disclosure by sending an e-mail request to privacy@abpeds.org listing your name, address, and e-mail address.\u00a0 You must also specifically indicate the nature of your request by including the following language or language substantially similar to it: \u201cI request that you send me your third-party information sharing disclosures as required by California Civil Code Section 1798.83.\u201d\u00a0 Alternatively, you can mail your request to the following address: 111 Silver Cedar Court, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, ATTN:\u00a0 Operations Department.\nHow to Contact the ABP\nQuestions regarding this Privacy Policy should be directed to us by email to privacy@abpeds.org, by phone at (919) 929-0461, or by writing to the following address: 111 Silver Cedar Court, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, ATTN:\u00a0 Operations Department.\nDate / Revision Date\nOrigination Date: September 1, 2004\nRevised: April 2011\nApproved by the Board of Directors:\u00a0 June 2011\nRevised:\u00a0 October 2011\nRevised:\u00a0 May 2012\nApproved by the Board of Directors:\u00a0 June 2012\nRevised: September 2012\nRevised: January 2013\nApproved by the Board of Directors: February 2013\nRevised:\u00a0 May 2013\nApproved by the Board of Directors:\u00a0 June 2013\nRevised: October 2013\nApproved by the Board of Directors: February 2014\nRevised February 2016\nApproved by the Board of Directors: March 2016\n", "friendly_summaries": [["We collect data directly on our website.
