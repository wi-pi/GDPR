Your California Privacy Rights We will not share any Personal Data with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes to the extent prohibited by California law. If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify you in advance. 9. Interest Based Advertising Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual's preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests. We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in the Pipedrive products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities. These third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which collect information about a person's interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements. In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar technologies. We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners. The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties' platforms. We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person's perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer. Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties. Visitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers; and http://www.networkadvertising.org. These features will opt a Visitor out of many \u2013 but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. 10. Do Not Track Policy California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals. In the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of this online behavioral advertising, visit the following sites: http://www.aboutads.info/consumers and http://www.networkadvertising.org. This will opt you out of many \u2013 but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third parties engage. Choices you make may be browser and device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out choices. Other third-party Sites provide visitors with the ability to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you need to control through your settings on that Site. For example, to opt out of Google's use of your online behavior for advertising purposes, visit Google's Ad Settings page. 11. Third Party Cookies California law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose whether other third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual's online activities from their site or service. We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site. These third parties include (1) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests. It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services. We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address); however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address). We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice.

We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows: the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 3 months of the date of closure; backups are kept for 3 months; billing information is retained for a period of 7 years as of their provision to Pipedrive in accordance with the Estonian accounting and taxation laws information on legal transactions between Client and Pipedrive is retained for a period of 10 years as of their provision to Pipedrive in accordance with the general limitation period set for civil claims in the Estonian General Part of the Civil Code Act", "15. Settings Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. 16. Data Transfer We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S. The U.S. may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services. When we transfer Personal Data to the U.S., we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy. The Service is hosted in the United States or Germany. EU customers' databases will be hosted in Pipedrive's EU datacenter located in Frankfurt, Germany. Regardless of the database being hosted in the EU, if you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing by our service providers listed in the Pipedrive Terms of Service. We will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. 17. Data Controller and Data Processor Pipedrive does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. Pipedrive is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users. Because Pipedrive does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Pipedrive is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter \"GDPR\") and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. Pipedrive should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Pipedrive does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Pipedrive in connection with Pipedrive's provision of Services to Clients. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User. The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data. Pipedrive is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors' servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Pipedrive responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information. If you need a signed Data Processing Addendum in addition to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you can find the document signed on behalf of Pipedrive here. 18. Changes and Updates to this Policy Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time. If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy. 19.

Interest Based Advertising\nInterest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order \tto predict an individual\u2019s preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone \tor tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining \tto that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.\nWe work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely \tto be interested in the Pipedrive products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our \tadvertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.\nThese third parties include: (a) advertising networks, which collect information about a person\u2019s interests when \tthat person views or interacts with one of their advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the \teffectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners, which collect information when a person views or \tinteracts with one of their advertisements.\nIn collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other \tindividuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them. Individuals \tmay submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our \tadvertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used \tfor this purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs, flash cookies, and similar \ttechnologies. We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.\nThe information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content \tthe person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in \tresponse to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties\u2019 platforms.\nWe, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the \tvarious activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We, or these third parties, do this for \tmany reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more personalized content; to \tprovide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the \tsame ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to \tdisplay or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person\u2019s perceived \tinterest in products or services similar to those that we offer.\nOur interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our \tproducts or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.\nVisitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising by advertising networks that may be delivered to them \ton our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites:\u00a0http://www.aboutads.info/consumers; \tand\u00a0http://www.networkadvertising.org. \tThese features will opt a Visitor out of many \u2013 but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we \tor third parties engage.\n10. Do Not Track Policy\nCalifornia law requires that operators of websites and online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track \tsignal. Some browsers have incorporated \u201cDo Not Track\u201d features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal \tor preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be \ttracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently \trespond to Do Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how \tto treat Do Not Track signals.\nIn the meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from advertising networks that may be \tdelivered on our platform and other websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of this online \tbehavioral advertising, visit the following sites:\u00a0http://www.aboutads.info/consumers\u00a0and\u00a0http://www.networkadvertising.org.\nThis will opt you out of many \u2013 but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities in which we or third \tparties engage. Choices you make may be browser and device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different \tbrowser or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out choices. Other third-party Sites \tprovide visitors with the ability to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you need to control \tthrough your settings on that Site. For example, to opt out of Google\u2019s use of your online behavior for advertising \tpurposes, visit Google\u2019s Ad Settings page.\n11.

This includes, for \texample, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt \tdata during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further \tanonymize Personal Data.\nHowever, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot \tensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your \town risk.

Data Controller and Data Processor\nPipedrive does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User \tvia the Service. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data. \tPipedrive is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the \tService and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide \tServices to the Client and its Users.\nBecause Pipedrive does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and \tbecause it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such \tPersonal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Pipedrive is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms \tof the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter \u201cGDPR\u201d) \u00a0and \tdoes not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. Pipedrive should be considered only as a processor on \tbehalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of \tthe GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Pipedrive does not independently cause Client Data containing \tPersonal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, \texcept to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Pipedrive in connection with Pipedrive\u2019s \tprovision of Services to Clients. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.\nThe Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, \tmeaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of \tthe purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.\nPipedrive is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information \tstored on its servers (or its subcontractors\u2019 servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Pipedrive \tresponsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise \tprocesses such information.\nIf you need a signed Data Processing Addendum in addition to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you can find \tthe document signed on behalf of Pipedrive\u00a0here.\n18. Changes and Updates to this Policy\nPlease revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to \ttime. If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest \trevision, and will comply with applicable law. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become \teffective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.\n19.
