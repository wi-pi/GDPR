In no event will\nwe disclose information obtained over the RCON connection to unauthorized\nusers unless that information is already publicly available. For example,\nplayer names are always public, whereas IPs are not.

They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to\nbetter match your interests and preferences. There are a couple\ndifferent types of cookies.\nA \u201csession\u201d cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory\n(RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your\nbrowser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session\ncookie disappears forever.\nA \u201cpersistent\u201d cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a\nspecified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from\nnow. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they\nexpire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually\nremove them.
