You will not be charged for a rejected transaction. 3.3. Fees. In general, Coinbase makes money when you purchase or sell digital currency on our Site.

If you initiate recurring Digital Currency Transactions, you authorize us to initiate recurring electronic payments in accordance with your selected Digital Currency Transaction and any corresponding payment accounts, such as recurring automated clearing house (ACH) debit or credit entries from or to your linked bank account. Your recurring transactions will occur in identical, periodic installments, based on your period selection (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), until either you or Coinbase cancels the recurring order. If you select a U.S. Bank Account as your payment method for a recurring transaction, and such transaction falls on a weekend or holiday, or after bank business hours, the ACH credit or debit will be executed on the next business day, although the Digital Currency fees at the time of the regularly-scheduled transaction will apply. If your Bank is unable to process any electronic ACH debit entry, we will notify you of cancellation of the transaction and may avail itself of remedies set forth in this User Agreement to recover any amount owed to Coinbase. This authorization will remain in full force and effect until you change your recurring transaction settings at https://www.coinbase.com/recurring_payments, or until you provide us written notification at https://support.coinbase.com. You agree to notify Coinbase in writing of any changes in your linked bank account information prior to a recurring transaction. Coinbase may, at any time, terminate recurring transactions by providing notice to you. 3.5. Revocation. When you give us instructions to purchase (buy) Digital Currency, you cannot withdraw your consent to that purchase unless the purchase is not scheduled to occur until a future date e.g. you set up a recurring purchase of Digital Currency (a \"Future Transaction\"). In the case of a Future Transaction, you may withdraw your consent up until the end of the business day before the date that the Future Transaction is scheduled to take place. To withdraw your consent to a Future Transaction, follow the instructions on the Coinbase Site. 3.6. Unauthorized and Incorrect Transactions. When a Digital Currency or USD transaction occurs using your credentials, we will assume that you authorized such transaction, unless you notify us otherwise. If you believe you did not authorize a particular transaction or that a transaction was incorrectly carried out, you must contact us as soon as possible either by email free of charge at support+trust@coinbase.com or by phone at +1 (888) 908-7930 (international call charges may apply). It is important that you regularly check your USD Wallet and Digital Currency Wallet balances and your transaction history regularly to ensure you notify us as soon as possible of any unauthorized or incorrect transactions to. We are not responsible for any claim for unauthorized or incorrect transactions unless you have notified us in accordance with this section. 3.7. Account Information. You will be able to see your USD Wallet and Digital Currency Wallet balances using the Coinbase Site. You can also see your transaction history using the Coinbase Site, including (i) the amount (and currency) of each Digital Currency Transaction, (ii) a reference to the identify of the payer and/or payee (as appropriate), (iii) any fees charged (excluding any spread, or margin, over the prevailing market rate on Coinbase's trading platform), (iv) if applicable, the rate of exchange, and the amount (in the new currency) after exchange (where you are the payer) or the amount (in the original currency) before the exchange (where you are the payee), and (v) the date of each Digital Currency Transaction. 3.8. Consent to access, processing and storage of your personal data. You consent to us accessing, processing and retaining any personal information you provide to us for the purpose of us providing Coinbase Services to you. This consent is not related to, and does not affect, any rights or obligations we or you have in accordance with data protection laws, privacy laws and regulations. You can withdraw your consent at any time by closing your account with us. However, we may retain and continue to process your personal information for other purposes. Please see our Privacy Policy for further information about how we process your personal data, and the rights you have in respect of this. 3.9. Reversals & Cancellations. You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful, if your payment method has insufficient funds, or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank account, you authorize Coinbase, in its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including your USD Wallet or Digital Currency Wallet balances or other linked accounts, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, non-sufficient funds (NSF), or similar fees charged by your payment provider. We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any Digital Currency Transaction or Transfers in our sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), if we suspect the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; if we reasonably suspect that the transaction is erroneous; or if Coinbase suspects the transaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below. In such instances, Coinbase will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same price or on the same terms as the cancelled transaction. 3.10. Payment Services Partners. Coinbase may use a third party payment processor to process any US Dollar payment between you and Coinbase, including but not limited to payments in relation to your use of the Digital Currency Transactions or deposits or withdrawals from your USD Wallet or Coinbase Pro Account. 4. Digital Currency Transfers 4.1. In General. If you have sufficiently verified your identity, your Digital Currency Wallet enables you to send Supported Digital Currency to, and request, receive, and store Supported Digital Currency from, third parties by giving instructions through the Coinbase Site. Your transfer of Supported Digital Currencies between your other digital currency wallets (including wallets off the Coinbase Site) and to and from third parties is a \"Digital Currency Transfer\". 4.3. Pending Transactions. Once a Digital Currency Transfer is submitted to a Digital Currency network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient to confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network. A Digital Currency Transfer is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending Digital Currency Transfers that are initiated from a Coinbase Account will reflect a pending transaction status and are not available to you for use on the Coinbase platform or otherwise while the transaction is pending. 4.4. Inbound Digital Currency Transfers. When you or a third party sends Digital Currency to a Coinbase wallet from an external wallet not hosted on Coinbase (\"Inbound Transfers\"), the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of sufficient network or miner's fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause an Inbound Transfer to remain in a pending state outside of Coinbase's control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions. By initiating an Inbound Transfer, you attest that you are transacting in a Supported Digital Currency which conforms to the particular Coinbase wallet into which funds are directed. For example, if you select an Ethereum wallet address to receive funds, you attest that you are initiating an Inbound Transfer of Ethereum alone, and not any other currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum Classic. Coinbase incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to unsupported digital currency sent to a Coinbase Account or Supported Digital Currency sent to an incompatible Digital Currency wallet. Erroneously transmitted funds will be lost. We recommend customers send a small amount of Supported Digital Currency as a test prior to initiating a send of a significant amount of Supported Digital Currency. Coinbase may from time to time determine types of Digital Currency that will be supported or cease to be supported. 4.5. Outbound Digital Currency Transfers. When you send Digital Currency from your Coinbase Account to an external wallet (\"Outbound Transfers\"), such transfers are executed at your instruction by Coinbase. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. Coinbase shall bear no liability or responsibility in the event you enter an incorrect blockchain destination address. We do not guarantee the identity or value received by a recipient of an Outbound Transfer. Digital Currency Transfers cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Currency network, although they may be in a pending state, and designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators. Coinbase does not control the Digital Currency network and makes no guarantees that a Digital Currency Transfer will be confirmed by the network. We may refuse to process or cancel any pending Outbound Digital Currency Transfers as required by law or any court or other authority to which Coinbase is subject in any jurisdiction. Additionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction before permitting you to use further Coinbase Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits. 4.6. Transfers to a Recipient Email Address. Coinbase allows you to initiate a Digital Currency Transfer to a Coinbase customer by designating that customer's email address. If you initiate a Digital Currency Transfer to an email address, and the recipient does not have an existing Coinbase Account, we will invite the recipient to open a Coinbase Account. If the recipient does not open a Coinbase Account within 30 days, we will return the relevant Digital Currency to your Digital Currency Wallet. 4.8. Third Party Merchants. We have no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase from a third party (including other users of Coinbase Digital Currency Services). We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party buyer or a seller you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party using Digital Currency transferred using the Coinbase Digital Currency Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify Coinbase Support at support+trust@coinbase.com so that we may consider what action to take, if any. 4.9 Debts. In the event that there are outstanding amounts owed to us hereunder, including in your Coinbase Account, Coinbase reserves the right to debit your Coinbase Account or Coinbase Pro Account accordingly and/or to withhold amounts from funds you may transfer from your Coinbase Pro Account to your Coinbase Account. 5.

You agree to use this process before filing any arbitration claim or small claims action. If you do not follow the procedures set out in this Section before filing an arbitration claim or suit in small claims court, we shall have the right to ask the arbitrator or small claims court to dismiss your filing unless and until you complete the following steps. 8.2.1. Procedural Steps. In the event that your dispute with Coinbase is not resolved through your contact with Coinbase Support, you agree to use our Complaint form to describe your Complaint, how you would like us to resolve the Complaint, and any other information related to your dispute that you believe to be relevant. The Complaint form can be found on the Coinbase support pages, support.coinbase.com or can be requested from Coinbase Customer Support. 8.2.2. Coinbase Response. We will acknowledge receipt of your Complaint form after you submit it. A Coinbase customer relations agent (\"Agent\") will review your Complaint. The Agent will evaluate your Complaint based on the information you have provided and information in the possession of Coinbase. Within 15 business days of our receipt of your Complaint form, the Agent will address the issues raised in your Complaint form by sending you an e-mail (\"Resolution Notice\") in which the Agent will: (i) offer to resolve your complaint in the way you requested; (ii) make a determination rejecting your Complaint and set out the reasons for the rejection; or (iii) offer to resolve your Complaint with an alternative solution.

Arbitration; Waiver of Class Action. If we cannot resolve the dispute through the Formal Complaint Process, you and we agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Coinbase Services, including, without limitation, federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, shall be resolved through binding arbitration, on an individual basis (the \"Arbitration Agreement\"). Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf). This Arbitration Agreement includes, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge. CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY \"CLASS ACTION WAIVER\"). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COINBASE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. An arbitrator's decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. To the extent permitted by law, the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement, any arbitration pursuant to this Agreement, or any small claims action shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law. 9. General Provisions 9.1. Computer Viruses. We shall not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses or other malicious code that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack. We advise the regular use of a reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software. You should also be aware that SMS and email services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from Coinbase.

Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual currency. Transactions in virtual currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some virtual currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer initiates the transaction. The value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual currency disappear. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a virtual currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time. The nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack. The nature of virtual currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by Coinbase may prevent the access or use of a customer's virtual currency. Any bond or trust account maintained by Coinbase for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.", "Texas If you have a complaint, please contact the consumer assistance division of Coinbase at https://support.coinbase.com or 1-888-908-7930.

Coinbase is not the issuer of USDC, does not hold U.S.\nDollars on reserve for USDC holders, and has no obligation to repurchase your USDC\nfor USD. You can redeem your USDC with Circle, and Coinbase may also elect to repurchase\nyour USDC in exchange for USD. You agree to be bound by the terms of the Circle\nUSDC Agreement (located at\nhttps://support.usdc.circle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001233386-Circle-USDC-User-Agreement),\nwhich provides additional obligations, undertakings, and limitations with respect\nto USDC.\n2.9 Coinbase Bundle. The Coinbase Bundle (\u201cBundle\u201d) is an offer to purchase\nmultiple Digital Currencies in a single-click transaction, subject to our current\nfees for purchasing Bundles. The Digital Currencies included in any Bundle are made\navailable by Coinbase in its sole discretion. The amount of each Digital Currencies\nin any Bundle offer is proportional to each Digital Currency\u2019s \u201cmarket capitalization\u201d,\ncalculated by multiplying its current price by the circulating supply of the Digital\nCurrency. By purchasing a Bundle, you understand and acknowledge that you have the\nability to sell and send each Digital Currency included in the Bundle at your discretion,\njust as if you had purchased each Digital Currency in separate transactions, by\nchoosing to \u201cunbundle\u201d the Bundle. Coinbase may allow you to perform a single transaction\nto sell an amount proportionally across all the Digital Currencies purchased as part\nof a Bundle, and Coinbase may allow this only if you have not previously unbundled\nyour purchased Bundle. A Bundle can not be reconstituted once it is unbundled. All\npricing or performance data related to the Bundle is for informational purposes only.\nA Bundle is not an offer to purchase any single security, investment or financial\ninstrument.

Purchase or Sale of Digital Currency. When you purchase (buy) Digital\nCurrency from Coinbase (or from a third-party using Coinbase Pro) this transaction\nis intended to effect a sale of Digital Currency. You can purchase (buy) Digital\nCurrency using: (a) funds in your USD Wallet, (b) Digital Currency held in certain\nDigital Currency Wallets, as permitted by Coinbase, (c) a valid bank account in\nthe name that matches the name on your Coinbase Account, or (d) a debit or credit\ncard that matches the name on your Coinbase Account (each a \"Valid Payment Method\").\nYour purchase must follow the relevant instructions on the Coinbase Site. Coinbase\nreserves the right to cancel any transaction not confirmed by you within five (5)\nseconds after Coinbase quotes a transaction price. A purchase of Digital Currency\nusing a Valid Payment Method generally will initiate on the business day we receive\nyour instructions. Purchased Digital Currency will be deposited in your Digital\nCurrency Wallet as soon as funds have settled to Coinbase, which in the case of a\nbank account or credit or debit card may take up to five business days. You can\nsell Digital Currency and instruct Coinbase to deposit funds into your Coinbase\nUSD Wallet or, where supported, a Digital Currency Wallet. Digital Currency purchases\nand sales are collectively referred to herein as \u201cDigital Currency Transactions\u201d.\nIf Coinbase cannot complete your Digital Currency Transaction for any reason (such\nas price movement, failure of Pro to respond, or an order exceeding the maximum order\nsize), Coinbase will reject the order and notify you of such rejection.

A full list of Coinbase fees for your Coinbase\nAccount can be found on our Pricing and Fees Disclosures\npage.\nBy using Coinbase Services you agree to pay all applicable fees. Coinbase\nreserves the right to adjust its pricing and fees and any applicable waivers at\nany time. We will always notify you of the pricing and fees which apply to your\ntransaction when you authorize the transaction and in each receipt we issue to\nyou. We may charge network fees (miner fees) to process a Digital Currency\nTransaction on your behalf. We will calculate the network fee in our\ndiscretion, although we will always notify you of the network fee at or before\nthe time you authorize the Digital Currency Transaction. Bank fees charged to\nCoinbase are netted out of transfers to or from Coinbase. You are responsible\nfor paying any additional fees charged by your financial service provider. We\nwill not process a transfer if associated bank fees exceed the value of the\ntransfer. You may be required to deposit additional USD to cover bank fees if\nyou desire to complete such a transfer.\n3.4. Recurring Digital Currency Transactions. If you initiate recurring Digital\nCurrency Transactions, you authorize us to initiate recurring electronic\npayments in accordance with your selected Digital Currency Transaction and any\ncorresponding payment accounts, such as recurring automated clearing house (ACH)\ndebit or credit entries from or to your linked bank account. Your recurring\ntransactions will occur in identical, periodic installments, based on your\nperiod selection (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), until either you or Coinbase\ncancels the recurring order. If you select a U.S. Bank Account as your payment\nmethod for a recurring transaction, and such transaction falls on a weekend or\nholiday, or after bank business hours, the ACH credit or debit will be executed\non the next business day, although the Digital Currency fees at the time of the\nregularly-scheduled transaction will apply. If your Bank is unable to process\nany electronic ACH debit entry, we will notify you of cancellation of the\ntransaction and may avail itself of remedies set forth in this User Agreement to\nrecover any amount owed to Coinbase. This authorization will remain in full\nforce and effect until you change your recurring transaction settings at\nhttps://www.coinbase.com/recurring_payments, or until you provide us written\nnotification at https://support.coinbase.com. You agree to notify Coinbase in\nwriting of any changes in your linked bank account information prior to a\nrecurring transaction. Coinbase may, at any time, terminate recurring\ntransactions by providing notice to you.\n3.5. Revocation. When you give us instructions to purchase (buy) Digital\nCurrency, you cannot withdraw your consent to that purchase unless the purchase\nis not scheduled to occur until a future date e.g. you set up a recurring\npurchase of Digital Currency (a \"Future Transaction\"). In the case of a Future\nTransaction, you may withdraw your consent up until the end of the business day\nbefore the date that the Future Transaction is scheduled to take place. To\nwithdraw your consent to a Future Transaction, follow the instructions on the\nCoinbase Site.\n3.6. Unauthorized and Incorrect Transactions. When a Digital Currency or USD\ntransaction occurs using your credentials, we will assume that you authorized\nsuch transaction, unless you notify us otherwise.

Consent to access, processing and storage of your personal data. You\nconsent to us accessing, processing and retaining any personal information you\nprovide to us for the purpose of us providing Coinbase Services to you.

Please see our Privacy\nPolicy for further\ninformation about how we process your personal data, and the rights you have in\nrespect of this.\n3.9. Reversals & Cancellations. You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any\ntransaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful, if\nyour payment method has insufficient funds, or if you reverse a payment made\nfrom funds in your bank account, you authorize Coinbase, in its sole discretion,\neither to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods,\nincluding your USD Wallet or Digital Currency Wallet balances or other linked\naccounts, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. You are\nresponsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits\nin order to avoid overdraft, non-sufficient funds (NSF), or similar fees charged\nby your payment provider. We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to\ncancel or reverse, any Digital Currency Transaction or Transfers in our sole\ndiscretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), if we\nsuspect the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money\nlaundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; in\nresponse to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; if we reasonably\nsuspect that the transaction is erroneous; or if Coinbase suspects the\ntransaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth\nbelow. In such instances, Coinbase will reverse the transaction and we are under\nno obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same\nprice or on the same terms as the cancelled transaction.\n3.10. Payment Services Partners. Coinbase may use a third party payment\nprocessor to process any US Dollar payment between you and Coinbase, including\nbut not limited to payments in relation to your use of the Digital Currency\nTransactions or deposits or withdrawals from your USD Wallet or Coinbase Pro\nAccount.\n4. Digital Currency Transfers\n4.1. In General. If you have sufficiently verified your identity, your Digital\nCurrency Wallet enables you to send Supported Digital Currency to, and request,\nreceive, and store Supported Digital Currency from, third parties by giving\ninstructions through the Coinbase Site. Your transfer of Supported Digital\nCurrencies between your other digital currency wallets (including wallets off\nthe Coinbase Site) and to and from third parties is a \u201cDigital Currency\nTransfer\u201d.\n4.3. Pending Transactions. Once a Digital Currency Transfer is submitted to a\nDigital Currency network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a\npending state for a period of time sufficient to confirmation of the transaction\nby the Digital Currency network. A Digital Currency Transfer is not complete\nwhile it is in a pending state. Pending Digital Currency Transfers that are\ninitiated from a Coinbase Account will reflect a pending transaction status and\nare not available to you for use on the Coinbase platform or otherwise while the\ntransaction is pending.\n4.4. Inbound Digital Currency Transfers. When you or a third party sends\nDigital Currency to a Coinbase wallet from an external wallet not hosted on\nCoinbase (\u201cInbound Transfers\u201d), the person initiating the transaction is solely\nresponsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among\nother things, payment of sufficient network or miner\u2019s fees in order for the\ntransaction to be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause an Inbound\nTransfer to remain in a pending state outside of Coinbase\u2019s control and we are\nnot responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the\ninitiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the\nremediation of such transactions. By initiating an Inbound Transfer, you attest\nthat you are transacting in a Supported Digital Currency which conforms to the\nparticular Coinbase wallet into which funds are directed. For example, if you\nselect an Ethereum wallet address to receive funds, you attest that you are\ninitiating an Inbound Transfer of Ethereum alone, and not any other currency\nsuch as Bitcoin or Ethereum Classic. Coinbase incurs no obligation whatsoever\nwith regard to unsupported digital currency sent to a Coinbase Account or\nSupported Digital Currency sent to an incompatible Digital Currency wallet.\nErroneously transmitted funds will be lost. We recommend customers send a small\namount of Supported Digital Currency as a test prior to initiating a send of a\nsignificant amount of Supported Digital Currency. Coinbase may from time to time\ndetermine types of Digital Currency that will be supported or cease to be\nsupported.\n4.5. Outbound Digital Currency Transfers. When you send Digital Currency from\nyour Coinbase Account to an external wallet (\u201cOutbound Transfers\u201d), such\ntransfers are executed at your instruction by Coinbase. You should verify all\ntransaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. Coinbase shall\nbear no liability or responsibility in the event you enter an incorrect\nblockchain destination address. We do not guarantee the identity or value\nreceived by a recipient of an Outbound Transfer. Digital Currency Transfers\ncannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital\nCurrency network, although they may be in a pending state, and designated\naccordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators. Coinbase\ndoes not control the Digital Currency network and makes no guarantees that a\nDigital Currency Transfer will be confirmed by the network. We may refuse to\nprocess or cancel any pending Outbound Digital Currency Transfers as required by\nlaw or any court or other authority to which Coinbase is subject in any\njurisdiction. Additionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time after\ncompletion of a transaction before permitting you to use further Coinbase\nServices and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain\nvolume limits.\n4.6. Transfers to a Recipient Email Address. Coinbase allows you to initiate a\nDigital Currency Transfer to a Coinbase customer by designating that customer\u2019s\nemail address. If you initiate a Digital Currency Transfer to an email address,\nand the recipient does not have an existing Coinbase Account, we will invite the\nrecipient to open a Coinbase Account. If the recipient does not open a Coinbase\nAccount within 30 days, we will return the relevant Digital Currency to your\nDigital Currency Wallet.\n4.8. Third Party Merchants. We have no control over, or liability for, the\ndelivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services\nthat you may purchase from a third party (including other users of Coinbase\nDigital Currency Services). We are not responsible for ensuring that a third\nparty buyer or a seller you transact with will complete the transaction or is\nauthorised to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services\npurchased from, or sold to, a third party using Digital Currency transferred\nusing the Coinbase Digital Currency Services, or if you have a dispute with such\nthird party, you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party. If\nyou believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or\ninappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third\nparty, you may notify Coinbase Support at support+trust@coinbase.com so that we\nmay consider what action to take, if any.\n4.9 Debts. In the event that there are outstanding amounts owed to us\nhereunder, including in your Coinbase Account, Coinbase reserves the right to\ndebit your Coinbase Account or Coinbase Pro Account accordingly and/or to\nwithhold amounts from funds you may transfer from your Coinbase Pro Account to\nyour Coinbase Account.\n5.

The arbitrator may award any relief that a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction could award and the arbitral decision may be\nenforced in any court. An arbitrator\u2019s decision and judgment thereon will not\nhave a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. At your request, hearings may\nbe conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for\nsubmitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings.
