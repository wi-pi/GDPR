Ulule\u00a0Ulule SAS develops and operates the Ulule crowdfunding platform. It puts project creators (\"project owners\") in contact with people wishing to support projects by making a financial contribution (\"contributors\"). Within the framework of these activities, we process personal data concerning you, whether you are a visitor to the website\u00a0Ulule.com\u00a0or a user (registered member, contributor or project owner).\u00a0\u2212 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The data processing manager is Ulule, a simplified joint-stock company with an authorised capital of \u20ac253,061, registered under number 794 710 830 in the Paris trade and companies register, having its head office at 8 rue Saint-Fiacre, 75002 Paris, FRANCE.\u00a0\u2212 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We collect and process your data in order to: manage our contractual and pre-contractual relations with users and future users, manage user accounts, enable the hosting and administration of fundraising events, commercial management and user relations, provide our services, including the user support service, promote our services and products and propose new services and products to you, carry out training and events linked with our services and products, manage the\u00a0Ulule.com\u00a0websites, host and manage opinions and comments, host and manage the Community forum, compile commercial performance statistics, analyse and follow the audiences of our sites and facilitate their browsing as well as those of our dedicated pages on the social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube), combat fraud, money laundering and the financing of terrorism, manage any outstanding payments, pre-litigation and litigation cases, manage the exercise of your rights, and manage any reports and notifications linked with content published on our websites or forum.\u00a0\u2212 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Certain data concerning you may be combined.\u00a0This may consist of data you communicate when using our\u00a0Ulule.com\u00a0websites and data gathered through cookies on the Internet (we invite you to read our Cookies Policy). Data combined in this way are then used for some of the above-mentioned purposes.\u00a0\u2212 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Some data is processed to make decisions as to the acceptance/refusal of a project or contribution. In connection with their legal obligation to combat fraud, money laundering and financing of terrorism, Ulule and its payment service providers (MANGOPAY and STRIPE) process data, including data combinations, to help their staff establish fraud risk levels concerning payments and fundraising events. This processing may be used to justify a decision taken by Ulule or MANGOPAY or STRIPE to refuse a fundraising event, but no decision is made without human intervention.\u00a0\u2212 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It can happen that you communicate so-called sensitive data on our sites: when you publish a project, fill in your user profile, participate in a project, or publish a comment or an article on our Community Forum, you can publicly\u00a0reveal highly personal information (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual preference, political opinions, state of health, etc.).\u00a0We thus recommend extreme caution when you describe your project or user profile, post comments or articles on the forum or participate in a project, in order to protect your privacy. It is also possible in certain cases to make \"anonymous\" contributions (see our online aid concerning this point\u00a0\u2013 your identity will only be known to Ulule and the project owner concerned).\u00a0\u2212 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As a project owner, in particular, you may communicate information concerning third parties (your staff, a person your project is designed to help, etc.).\u00a0The processing of these data must comply with the regulations. You should check that you have the right to communicate these data to Ulule and to the public (for example, by obtaining the written agreement of these third parties) and communicate information to these parties on Ulule's processing of the data as indicated in this Privacy Policy.\u00a0\u2212 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is obligatory to collect certain data. We need certain information to provide you with our services. Whenever we collect data through forms, the obligatory or optional nature of your answers is made clear in each form. The consequences of not providing an answer for an obligatory response depend on the situation. It will mainly mean that you cannot create an account, submit or contribute to a project, or benefit from some of our services (the requirement to provide information is contractual or regulatory in this case if the information required is connected with our legal obligations as a crowdfunding platform), and that we cannot meet requests from you concerning the exercise of your rights (the requirement to provide information in this case is regulatory).\u00a0\u2212 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The parties who may receive data from Ulule\u00a0are mainly our subcontractors, project owners, Ulule partners, if your project is participating in a partner operation, and the judicial and administrative authorities.\u00a0\u2212 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You have rights.

The fact of contributing to a project can sometimes reveal sensitive or highly personal information (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual preference, political opinions, state of health, etc.). For example, by contributing to a project with a political dimension, you indirectly reveal your political opinions.
