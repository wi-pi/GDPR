COMPETITIONS AND PRIZES\n\nWhen you upload Content for entry into one of our photo challenges, the Photocrowd.com team may, after the closing date for the relevant challenge, act as resident judges and experts to determine a shortlist of finalists. This shortlist of finalists will then be provided to any guest or external judge/expert (as advertised in the relevant challenge) to select the winner and runners up of the relevant competition. In all cases the published rules of the challenge will apply and the judge\u2019s decision is final and binding.  After expert judging (or crowd voting, as the case may be) to select winners has finished, the prize winners will be notified  by email to the winning user\u2019s email account. To be confirmed as a winner and to be awarded the prize, the winning user may be required to confirm full legal ownership of the winning Content and, where applicable, that the winning Content was first created during the relevant challenge period. Should a prize notification or prize addressed to a particular user be returned as undeliverable, we will not resend the notice (whether by the same or another method), research the user's address or make any further attempts at delivery or contact. Where a winner's shipping address is located in a country or area designated by Photocrowd.com, in its sole discretion, as undeliverable, we reserve the right to provide a cash payment sent via PayPal or voucher of equal value to the advertised prize instead of the specific advertised prize. Prizes are not transferable.\nWinners will be announced after the confirmation required above is received and the respective winner(s) are confirmed. Photocrowd.com reserves the right to announce prize winners collectively, one at a time, or in any order or clusters as it deems appropriate, in its discretion, except that the winner of expert-judged or crowd-rated prizes will be announced within thirty (30) days of the date on which the confirmation required above is received from the winner. The dispatch of prizes to winners will be the sole responsibility of  the prize sponsor.

Prizewinners assume all liability for any injury or damage caused, or claimed to be caused, by participation in any Photocrowd.com competition and/or use/redemption of any prize.  We will not be liable for the actions or omissions of third party challenge sponsors or organisers, even if the challenge  is promoted on our website. \n7.

IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold harmless Photocrowd.com and its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and costs resulting from or arising out of: (a) your breach of these Terms, (b) any Content posted by you on the Photocrowd.com website, (c) use of the Photocrowd.com Services by you or any person using your username and/or password, and (d) any violation by you of any rights of a third party.\n9. OUR LIABILITIES\n\nIn no event shall Photocrowd.com be liable in contract, tort or otherwise with respect to the Photocrowd.com website, our Services or the Content: (a) for any lost profits,  loss of business, loss of data, unauthorised access to data or deficient data secrecy in connection with the transfer of information via the Internet, or for any misuse of Content published on our website or any other special, incidental or consequential costs, losses or damage of any kind whatsoever, (b) to provide substitute goods or services, except as provided for in these Terms, or (c) for any direct damages in excess of any subscription price paid by the user that is the subject of the claim to use the Photocrowd.com Services.  The terms of this clause shall not prevent any liability or claim for death or bodily injury nor any claim arising from wilful default or gross negligence on our part. \nWe undertake from time to time to use reasonable efforts to give you access to our website and Services.  We reserve the right to, at our sole discretion and when we deem necessary due to technical, operational, maintenance or security reasons, take measures which may affect the accessibility of our website and Services.  Due to the nature of Internet and server provision, downtime and lost transmissions may occur and accordingly we will have no liability to you for the loss of any Content or for any deterioration or damage to any Content or any failure of our website or Services.\n10. ENDING THIS AGREEMENT\n\nPhotocrowd.com may terminate or suspend any and all of its Services and/or your Photocrowd.com account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services will immediately cease.  You can terminate your Photocrowd.com account at any time by giving notice to us to that effect. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranties, indemnities and limitations of liability. Upon termination of your account we will  use all reasonable endeavours to remove all Content posted to your account.  If Content is removed, then any third party uses then existing will still remain and we will still be able to grant rights of use for: (i) Content relating to a specific use that has already been downloaded by a Customer for the purpose of such specific use prior to removal, or in respect of which we had entered into negotiations with any Customer prior to the date of removal, for a period of one year following removal, (ii) Content that is being re-used by a Customer, if we reasonably believe that the re-use is the same or very closely similar to the previous use.  In addition, where Content has been entered in a challenge and been given an award or an expert image review, a copy of that will be retained on the site as part of the archive for that photo challenge, or in connection with the expert image review. You will ensure that following termination you will not enter into any arrangement which conflicts with any rights of use granted by us.\n11. CHANGING THESE TERMS\n\nPhotocrowd.com reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If the alterations constitute a material change to the Terms, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Photocrowd.com website. What constitutes a material change will be determined by us. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Using any service or viewing any Content following notification of a material change to the Terms shall constitute your acceptance of the Terms as modified.\n12. THIRD PARTIES USING OUR SERVICES OR WEBSITE\n\nWe may from time to time permit third parties and entities (\u201cThird Party Users\u201d) to use our website as a platform to create their own groups of users, invite others to join them, run their own contests and assignments (\u201cChallenges\u2019) and to direct users to the Third Party User\u2019s sales channels.  In such cases you acknowledge that:\n\u2022   any permission to use our website or Services is not to be taken as a recommendation or endorsement regarding any activities carried out by the Third Party Users;  \n\u2022   we are not responsible or liable for the actions and omissions of any Third Party Users but we undertake to investigate any reported problems.  \nIf you are a Third Party User you will:\n\u2022   be bound by all applicable obligations set out in these Terms and in Photocrowd.com\u2019s Privacy Policy;\n\u2022   be solely responsible and liable for your acts or omissions;\n\u2022   be bound by such rules as we may from time to time specify;\n\u2022    not act in such a way to bring us or our website or Services into disrepute; \n\u2022   act fairly and honestly in all your interactions with users at all times;\n\u2022   indemnify and hold harmless Photocrowd.com and its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and costs resulting from or arising out of (a) your breach of these Terms, (b) any Content posted by users on the Photocrowd.com website, (c) your use of the Photocrowd.com website or Services, and (d) any violation by you of any rights of a third party;.\n\u2022    not have the right to use Content submitted by a user or member of your group, except as agreed by the user or member when making any submission. \n13. PAYMENTS AND COMMISSION\n\nWhere you have consented to the grant of rights of use in and to the Content to Customers we will account to you for any net royalties.  'Net royalties' means the gross income derived from the exploitation of the grant of use, less (i) our commission, at the rates advised to you from time to time, (ii) any amounts deducted by agents, distributors or sub-licensees (if applicable), (iii) any costs of sales, such as payment to third party printers, and (iv) sales tax (if applicable).  The net royalties you receive may vary depending on the subscription tier that you purchase.  Where you change subscription tiers it may take a little time to put the new royalty rate in place.  Arrangements for payment of any amounts due to you will be as advised to you from time to time.\n\n\nYou agree that we have the right to use your Content fully or partially for promotional reasons and in promotional/marketing material and activity without charge or prior consent or approval from you at our sole discretion and to distribute and redistribute your Content to other parties, websites, applications, and other entities, provided we use reasonable endeavours to ensure that such Content is attributed to you in accordance with the information submitted to us by you. You agree that any such promotional activities may be carried out by us notwithstanding the earlier termination of the contract for any reason and notwithstanding the removal of Content where that Content has already been selected for use in advertising and promotional activity in accordance with this clause. \n15. SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BILLING\n\nWe offer the facility to sign up to a number of subscription plans, including plans with differing tiers, conditions, limitations and features or for you to enter into individual photo challenges on payment of a fee. You can sign up to such plans or find specific details regarding your subscription or our pricing on our website. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered pricing and subscription plans from time to time. You can upgrade, downgrade or cancel your subscription plan using your online account on the website. If you are signing up to a subscription plan or paying a fee you must provide us with or use a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be advised by us from time to time (\"Payment Method\"). We will bill the subscription or any other fee, and any applicable taxes such as value added tax, to your Payment Method. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each subscription period in order to avoid billing of the next period's subscription fees to your Payment Method. Where you change your plan during a subscription period, we may bill you any difference between the subscription fee for your old and new plans for the remainder of that period. The amount billed for the subscribed plan is a recurring amount which will only be varied in the event that you change your plan or we adjust the prices. Where the applicable subscription fee is varied, you authorise us to charge your Payment Method for such varied amounts. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our Service in our sole discretion. Any price changes will take effect no earlier than 30 days following notice to you. Subject to an initial 14-day cooling off period within which you will receive a full refund in the event of cancellation (except when rating has already commenced in respect of a photo challenge that you have entered), all payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.\n16. SPECIFIC TERMS APPLICABLE TO CUSTOMERS\n\nIn addition to the other terms set out above, if you are a Customer purchasing a licence to Content from us you agree that:\n\u2022   you will have a non-exclusive (unless otherwise stated by us), non-sublicensable and non-assignable right to reproduce the Content solely in the manner and for the purpose  specified in our invoice/sales note set out in the invoice, including the use, medium, period of time, territory and any other restrictions;\n\u2022   you must comply with any of our policies regarding altering, cropping or manipulating Content, as advised to you or as set out on our website;\n\u2022   no ownership or copyright in any Content shall pass to you and you will not remove any notice of copyright, trademark or other propriety right from anywhere on the Content;\n\u2022   we do not warrant the accuracy of the captioning, keywording or any other information associated with the Content;\n\u2022   you may not use the Content in a pornographic, defamatory, fraudulent, lewd, obscene or otherwise illegal manner, including but not limited to infringing any third party intellectual property or privacy rights, whether directly or in context or by juxtaposition with other materials;\n\u2022   if any Content is reproduced by you for editorial purposes (i.e. for any non-promotional purpose) you must include a copyright/credit attribution as advised by us;\n\u2022   you will examine the Content for possible defects (whether digital or otherwise) before sending it for reproduction.  If you notify us within 30 days of a defect in Content materials or workmanship you are entitled to another digital copy of the Content free from defect or a refund of the Licence Fee paid by you at our option but otherwise we make no other warranty, express or implied;\n\u2022   we give no representations or warranties whatsoever as to the existence of any releases, such as a model or property release or any other release of a third party right or other permission which it is necessary or desirable to obtain, in respect of the Content (\u201cReleases\u201d).  We give no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to the use of names, trade marks, logos, uniforms, registered or copyrighted designs or artistic works depicted in any Content, and you must satisfy yourself that all Releases as may be required for reproduction of the Content have been secured, you are solely responsible for obtaining all such Releases and the rights granted to you are conditional in each case on your obtaining them. If you are unsure as to whether any Releases are needed for your Content usage, then it is your responsibility to consult with relevant parties. You will not rely upon any representation or warranty given by our employees or representatives save as set out in these Terms.\n\u2022   the fee charged to you depends on the nature of the rights granted. You agree to notify us in the event that you desire to expand the usage for the Content and pay any additional fee. Use of any Content in a manner not specifically authorised under the terms set out in our invoice/sales note or elsewhere in these Terms constitutes a breach of these Terms and an infringement of copyright.\n\u2022   the Content may not be sublicensed, resold or otherwise made available for use or distribution separately or detached from a product or web page. For example, the Content may be used as an integral part of a web page design, but may not be made available for downloading separately or in a format designed or intended for permanent storage or re-use by website users. Similarly, your customers may be provided with copies of the Content as an integral part of work product, but may not be provided with the Content or permitted to use the Content separately\n\u2022   where you purchase Products from the site the purchase will be subject to the following additional terms and conditions:\nTo order a product you will need to follow the ordering procedures set out on our order page. Details of our prices for the Products, and the procedures for payment and delivery are displayed on our web site.  Any times or dates stated on our web site for delivery are estimates only. We or our providers will make all reasonable effort to deliver goods within the time specified, but do not accept liability for any failure to deliver within that time.  You must pay by the designated payment method at the time of order. The price of any Product is the price in force at the date and time of your order. We may change the price of any Product before you place an order. We try to ensure that our prices displayed on our web site are accurate but the price on your order may need to be validated by us as part of the acceptance procedure. We will inform you if a Product\u2019s correct price is higher than that stated in your order and you may cancel the order and decide whether or not to order the product at the correct price.  In addition to the price we will set out delivery costs and applicable taxes.  We are entitled to refuse any order placed by you. If your order is accepted, we or our provider will confirm acceptance to you by online electronic means (\u2018Confirmation\u2019) to the email address you have given us on registration or on ordering. The order will then be fulfilled by the date set out in the Confirmation or, if the Confirmation does not contain such a date, within 30 days.  If the Product you ordered is unavailable, we may provide to you a substitute of an equivalent quality and price.  You may return any Products you have purchased within 30 days of delivery for any reason (including if you simply change your mind). To do so you must notify us in writing or other durable medium (including email) within those 30 days. You will then be entitled to a refund from us, which will be paid as soon as possible, but in any event within 30 days. You must arrange for and pay the costs of returning the Products tous or our provider.  While in your possession, you must keep any Products you intend to return to us in good condition.  Except as set out in this contract, all warranties, conditions, terms and undertakings, express or implied, whether by statute, common law, custom, trade usage, course of dealings or otherwise (including without limitation as to quality, performance or fitness or suitability for purpose) in respect of any Products are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n17. SELF BILLING FOR UK VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) REGISTERED USERS\n\nIf we implement self billing for UK VAT registered users the following terms and conditions will apply:\nYou must inform us whether you are registered for VAT and must inform us if at any time the position changes including any change in your VAT registered status, a change of your VAT number or if you sell all or part of your business.  Where you are UK VAT registered, you agree that we will self bill you.  We will issue self-billed invoices to you for all Taxable Supplies made to us by you (Taxable Supplies is defined by HM Customs & Excise as all goods and services which are VAT rated). The self-billed invoices will include your name, address and VAT number, together with all other details that constitute a full VAT invoice.  Our VAT number is 192435401 and we will agree new terms for self billing with you if our VAT number changes and we will inform you if the self-billed invoices are outsourced to a third party.  If it is subsequently found that you were not VAT registered or have failed to provide accurate and current information relating to your VAT status, then you shall immediately on demand by us repay to us any VAT paid over incorrectly (together with any associated interest and penalties incurred by us).  We may recover by debiting your account any money due to us in respect of tax and any associated interest or penalties.\n18. FINAL POINTS\n\nNo person who is not a party to these Terms may enforce them and any legislation according rights to third parties shall not apply. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Photocrowd.com in any respect whatsoever. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for in these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of that right or any further rights. Photocrowd.com shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations in these Terms where such failure results from any cause beyond Photocrowd.com\u2019s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Photocrowd.com may transfer or assign these Terms and its rights and obligations under them without consent but you may only transfer or assign the same with our prior written consent. The Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and settle any disputes. Both parties agree that these Terms represent the full mutual understanding of the parties and supersede all and any previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided above.  Any notice under these Terms may be sent electronically to the email address notified by each party to the other and will be deemed to have been received on the expiration of 48 hours after service. We will handle and process your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and all applicable data protection and privacy laws.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about our terms and conditions, please contact us by email at the following address:\nsupport@photocrowd.com\nYou may also want to take a look at our Privacy Policy\n\n\n", "friendly_summaries": [["We collect data directly on our website.
