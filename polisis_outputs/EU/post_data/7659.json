Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing. This Privacy Policy explain our practices and how you can opt-out of having your information shared with third parties for the third parties' direct or indirect marketing purposes.
