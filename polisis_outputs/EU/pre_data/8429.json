We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to monitor, edit or delete communications transmitted to us or that are made publicly available on the Services. This reservation of rights shall not under any circumstances obligate us to conduct such edits or deletions, nor shall it cause us to be liable for any such edits or deletions.\nAutomatically-Collected Information\nWe may automatically collect information about how you access and use the Services. For example, we may collect and store information such as your browser type, IP address, language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, the pages you view, the services you use, the date and time of your visit, the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting our websites, error logs, and other hardware and software information. \u00a0Fortinet maintains log files of the traffic that visits our sites. We do not link any information gathered in these log files to personal information. Log files are used to manage traffic loads and information technology requirements for providing reliable service.We may use third party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, and various technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. We may use this information to formulate statistical models about use of the Services, enhance the Services for our users, and provide you with tailored content and advertising.To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on by clicking here\nWe may also employ certain applications, such as the various components of Security Center, to retrieve information about your computer system to assist us in the provision of services that you have chosen to subscribe to or use. This information is essential to enable us to provide you with quality service, and for that reason there is no opt-out available for this information collection.\nOur Use of Cookies. This Services may use \u201ccookie\u201d technology and similar online tools, such as web beacons and web pixels. \u201cCookies\u201d are small files that a website stores on a user\u2019s computer or device. \u00a0We use cookies to identify customers when they visit our sites. Cookies are used to remember user preferences and maximize performance of the Services. Additionally, cookies help us to identify returning users so that we don't ask them to enter their email and password with every visit.Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, the information we collect with cookies is not sold, rented, or shared with any outside parties.We do not use cookies to obtain or retain any personal information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this). Please note that if you decide to block cookies, this may interfere with your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on the Services.For example, we cannot provide subscription services to users who do not give their consent to the data processing carried out through cookies or whose browsers are set to reject all cookies.\nTailored Advertising.\u00a0 The Services may include third party tailored ad technology which enables customized ads to be displayed to you through the Services. We do not share information that is intended to identify you personally with these third parties; however, when you use the Services, we or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use device or similar information that is collected through cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, or similar technologies to ensure that appropriate ads are presented and to perform analytics concerning your use of the Services and other websites tracked by these third parties. These technologies also may control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. To the extent any of this information is collected by third parties, you acknowledge and agree that such collection and use is governed by those third parties\u2019 privacy policies and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties.\nIf you are interested in more information about tailored ads and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored ads, you may visit the following third party websites: the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out Page. \u00a0You can also visit the Google Ad Settings page to opt out of receiving tailored ads from Google.Please note that to the extent ad technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive ads even if you opt-out of tailored ads. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, the opt-out services provided by the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance are controlled by those third parties, not Fortinet, and Fortinet does not control which companies choose to participate in those programs.\nDo Not Track. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the various advertising opt outs above.However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.\nInformation from Third Parties\nWe may obtain additional information about you from third parties such as marketers, partners, researchers, and others.We may combine information that we collect from or about you with information we obtain about you from such third parties and affiliates and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.\nAnonymous or De-Identified Data\nWe may anonymize and/or de-identify information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information does not identify you.Our use and disclosure of aggregated, anonymized, and other non-personal information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.\nUse of Your Information\nFortinet uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to:\n\nProcess and respond to your inquiries\nHelp you complete a transaction, including fulfillment of orders and promotional offers;\nSend you marketing or other communications that may be of interest to you;\nUpdate you on service and benefits;\nAnalyze the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Services;\nImprove the content and features of the Services or develop new Services;\nAdminister and troubleshoot the Services;\nEnforce the legal terms that govern the Services;\nPersonalize the Services for you; and\nManage and renew your subscription(s).\n\nCredit card numbers are used only for payment processing and fraud protection, and are not used for other purposes without your permission.\nSharing of Your Information\nExcept as provided in the Privacy Policy, Fortinet will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others for commercial gain. We may share your information in the following ways:\n\nWe reserve the right to engage other companies or individuals to provide limited services on our behalf that may involve sharing your information, such as the activities discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, handling the processing and delivery of mailings, order fulfillment, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, marketing, customer support, or performing statistical analysis. \u00a0Such parties may not use your personal information for other purposes, unless you agree.\nWe may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal processes; (b) protect the rights or property of Fortinet or our partners or customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies; or (c) protect the personal safety of individuals such as Fortinet employees, partners, customers or the public.\nWe may share your information with any affiliate or agent of Fortinet in order to provide the Services or advertising or to communicate with you on our behalf.\nWe may also disclose, sell or assign personal information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or restructuring.\nWhen we have your consent.\n\nYour Email Marketing Choices\nIf you provide us with your email address when you register as a customer or make a purchase from us, we may occasionally send you email with recommendations or notices of new products, prices, and services. This email may include paid advertisements from third parties. At the time you register or make a purchase, you will be given the opportunity to opt into our out of this service. If you do not initially choose to opt out, you may still block future email of this type, simply by following the unsubscribe instructions that accompany all such communications. Please note that these opt-out processes may take some time to complete, consistent with applicable law.\nSeparately, we send service notifications via email to keep you informed about the status of your service orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our services. Therefore there is no opt-out available for service notifications and these messages cannot be blocked.\nWe follow industry standard practices for email marketing and customer contact, and we urge our business partners to do so as well.\nThird Party Links and Services\nThe Services may contain links to third-party websites, including social networking websites. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites or services to which we link. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites or services. The personal information you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We strongly encourage you to read such third parties\u2019 privacy policies.\nSecurity of Your Personal Information\nWe have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.\nAlthough we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.\nIf a password is used to help protect your personal information, it is your responsibility to keep the password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone.\nHow You Can Access and Update Your Personal Information\nTo ensure that you have some control over the information we have about you, you may review and update certain user information by logging in to the relevant portions of the Services where such information may be updated (may be available on some Services and not others) or by contacting us at the contact information provided below.\nInternational Compliance\nFortinet complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. \u00a0Fortinet has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement; however, Fortinet does not currently rely on the onward transfer principle with respect to the transfer of personal data from the EU to the US. \u00a0To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.
