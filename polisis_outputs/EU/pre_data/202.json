reminder, MakerBot\u2019s Privacy Policy applies to all MakerBot-owned and licensed applications.\nWe updated this MakerBot Privacy Policy to describe the personal data that may be collected during your use of our Customer Support (as defined in Section 7 of the MakerBot Terms of Use), such as your product serial number. \n\nOther than the above, the way that we use and disclose your personal information, and the choices you have, remain the same.\n\nMakerBot Industries, LLC (\u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cMakerBot,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d and/or \u201cwe\u201c) is committed to protecting the privacy of our Users (\u201cUsers,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d and/or \u201cyour\u201d). We have prepared the MakerBot Privacy Policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from Users of our Sites, Services, and the rest of the MakerBot Ecosystem, including but not limited to mobile apps, the MakerBot Desktop App, and MakerBot 3D printers. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in the MakerBot Terms of Use located here. By using and accessing the Sites, you consent and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into the MakerBot Terms of Use.\n\n\n1. USER CONSENT. By submitting Personal Data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\n\n2. A NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN.  We do not intentionally gather, use, or disclose Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13, and neither our Site nor our Services are intended for children under this age.\n\n\n3. A NOTE TO USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.\n\n\n4. TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. \u201cNon-Personal Data\u201d means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Non-Personal Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Non-Personal Data as described below.\n\n(A) Information You Provide to Us\n\nWe may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses, professional title, company name, your industry, and password when you create a Company Account.\n\n\nWe retain information on your behalf, such as designs and other files and messages that you store using your Company Account.\n\n\nIf you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail for any purpose, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, such as a product serial number.\n\n\nWe may collect Personal Data from you when you interact with our employees or contractors. Additionally, we may monitor and record phone calls, video calls, e-mails, live chats, or other communications between you, your device, and our employees or contractors. \n\n\nWhen you participate in one or more activities through our Sites and Services or directed at our official social media handles, including, but not limited to, our surveys, contests, sweepstakes, giveaways, and educational or training classes, we may collect the additional information provided by you for such participation. You should read the separate terms and conditions that govern these activities.\n\n\nWhen you post messages or other content on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it, including in commercial contexts. For example, we collect the profile name and profile photo you may post to the Sites, and actions you take on our Sites or on third-party applications connected to your Company Account through the use of our Services.\n\n\nWe also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us regarding support for the Services.\n\n\nWe may also collect Personal Data, such as at other points in our Site that state that Personal Data is being collected.\n\nB) Information Collected via Technology\n\nTo make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, unique system/hardware identifier, a date/time stamp for your visit and/or any other unique attributes that are available to us via your use of our Sites, Services, and technology.\n\n\nWe also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding your visit to our Sites, among other things we collect the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. \u201cCookies\u201d are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer\u2019s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to identify you and among other things provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site and Services. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.\n\n\nInformation may be aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered Non-Personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\n\n\nWe may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). MakerBot may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Company Account.\n\n\nWe may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide MakerBot with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers.\n\n\nWe may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\n\n\nWe may collect certain usage statistics (the \u201cUsage Statistics\u201c). The Usage Statistics may include, but are not limited to date and time of action (such as, for example, when you print a file, purchase a product or browse the Sites), type of action, any parameters associated with the type of action, your IP address, and your user Thingiverse/MakerBot ID. The Thingiverse/MakerBot ID will only be shared if you are also logged in to the Thingiverse/MakerBot website and/or relevant parts of the MakerBot Ecosystem.\n\n(C) Information Collected from Third Party Companies.\n\nWe may receive Personal and/or Non-Personal Data about you from companies that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Site. These third party companies may supply us with Personal Data. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site in order to improve the Services we provide.\n\n\nMakerBot may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc (\u201cGoogle\u201d) or any other analytics services. Google Analytics or other analytics services use cookies and text files, which may be stored on your computer or other device. These cookies collect anonymous traffic data and/or Personal Data that allows for an analysis of your usage of the MakerBot Ecosystem.\n\nFor more information on Google, please read:\n5. USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA\n\n(A) GENERAL USE. In general, we use your Personal Data to administer and improve the Sites and Services, to track your movement around the Sites, to protect MakerBot and our Users. Personal Data may either be used to respond to your requests, and to offer more personally tailored content and services. For example, some of the Personal Data we collect may be used so that when you visit the Site or use the Services again, it will recognize you and could provide you more relevant content suggestions on Thingiverse, customized search results, or other information appropriate to your interests.\n\nWe may use your Personal Data in the following ways:\n\nto facilitate the creation of and secure your Company Account on our network;\nidentify you as a user in our system;\nto show certain Company Account information such as your profile name and profile photo when you post on Thingiverse\nto combine across our different Services, such as, for example, applying your shipping information from one Service to another to make it easier for you to fill in\nto allow you share digital content, including designs files for printable objects with other users;\nto improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Site and Services, including notifying you about upcoming changes or improvements;\nto send you service messages such as a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your Company Account was created;\nto send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security, support, update, and maintenance advisories;\nto respond to your inquiries, including but not limited to employment opportunities;\nto help you solve any issues you contact us about. In such cases, we may keep a record of your communication.\nto make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of secondary fraud protection or to solicit your feedback or to notify you if we have your permission; and\n    to send newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials related to our Services and for other marketing purposes of Company.\n\n\n(B) Creation of Non-Personal Data. We may create Non-Personal Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Non-Personal Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Site navigation. Company reserves the right to use Non-Personal Data for any purpose and disclose Non-Personal Data to third parties in its sole discretion.\n\n\n6. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA. We disclose your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.\n\n\n(A)\tINFORMATION DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. We may share your Personal Data with third party service providers: to provide you with the Services that we offer you through our Site; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical support; and/or to provide other services to the Company. These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Company. When you use third party Applications or other services that use, or are integrated with, the MakerBot Ecosystem, they may receive information about what you already share publicly. Information shared publicly may be made available via the Application. For example, the Developer may get information about your User Content and/or your public profile. Information collected by these Applications or integrated services is also subject to their own terms and policies.\n\n\n(B)\tAFFILIATES AND ACQUISITIONS. We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (\u201cMakerBot Affiliates\u201c), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n\n(C)\tOTHER DISCLOSURES. Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Company may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Company; (c) to protect or defend the rights or property of Company or users of the Services; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or Terms of Use.\n\n7.

We may use third-party advertising companies services to serve and show you ads when you visit our Site and on other websites. These companies may collect and use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services to you.

Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites.\n\n8. YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL DATA\n\n(A) CHOICES. We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data.\n\n\n(I) We will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our Site or Services.

When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but certain past Personal Data may remain in our archives. We may retain, use, or disclose your information to prevent or detect fraud or similar purposes.\n\n\n9. SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA. Company is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data.

We also require you to enter a password to access your Company Account information. Please do not disclose your Company Account password to unauthorized people.

Therefore, while Company uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, Company cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n\n\n10. DO NOT TRACK. Currently, (i) other parties (e.g. third-party advertising networks and analytics providers) may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our website or services, and (ii) we do not respond to, or take any specific action in connection with the receipt of, Do-Not-Track signals or other similar mechanisms regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer\u2019s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.\n\n\n11.

In any event, changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of Personal Data that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your Personal Data, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your Company Account with us.
