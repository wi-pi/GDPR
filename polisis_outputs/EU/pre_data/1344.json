A pixel tag is a type of technology which is placed on a website or within an email and used for the purpose of tracking activity on a website and is often used in combination with cookies.  For further information about how we use and collect cookies, see our separate cookie policy located at [https://www.entrepreneur.com/cookie-policy].\nWe do not track our users across third party websites and thus do not respond to Do Not Track (\"DNT\") signals. However, some third party websites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, certain website browsers allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.\n\n3. The Advertising on Our Service.\n\n\t\tAdvertising on our Service makes it possible for us to offer you the information and products/services free of charge. We take seriously and make every effort to make sure that advertising is safe, unobtrusive and as relevant as possible.\nCookies are used to make that advertising as relevant as possible to the needs and interests of users of our Service, and more valuable to our advertisers in being able to show our visitors more relevant ads. Cookies are also used to avoid you seeing the same ad multiple times and to detect and prevent click fraud. We use AdSense, Google Analytics and other DoubleClick services (collectively, \"Google\u00ae Services\"), which help us manage and improve our Service and help our advertisers better understand and track user interaction with their ads. When you visit a location on our Service that includes one or more of these ads, various cookies may be sent to your browser.\nWe may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, which provide the functionality for such displays as interactive advertising. We may also use your IP address to select and provide advertising targeted to that address, in order to improve the relevance of the ads you see and to measure and report to advertisers non-personal statistical information about geographical location of those website visitors who are viewing their ads.\nThe advertising you see on our Service is determined by a number of factors relating to relevance, including (i) your approximate geographical location base on you IP address and (ii) the subject matter you may be viewing on our Service. For example, if you are viewing an article about physical health, you may see ads concerning exercise equipment.\nIf you wish to know more about the information collected from website users and used to tailor those advertisements for products and services which might be of the most interest and relevance to those users, or would like to know more about the user\u2019s options in connection with the collection and use of that information, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") website at http://www.networkadvertising.org. The NAI is a cooperative of online advertising companies who are committed to responsible practices and consumer protection.\n\t\t\n\n4. Privacy and Choice.\n\n\t\tPeople have different concerns about privacy. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how that information is used. You may set your browser in its \"options\" or \"preferences\" feature in order to warn you before accepting cookies or to disable all cookies entirely. However, it is important to understand that many of the services we provide on our Service and to our Service users may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.\n\n5. Minors and Children under the Age of 16.\n\n\t\tEMI does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register to use our Service. No one under age 16 is allowed to provide any personal information to EMI or on the Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under age 16, please contact us at legal@entrepreneur.com.\n\n6. Where We Store the Information\n\n\t\tThe data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of your country and the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") including, in particular, the United States. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.\n\n7. The Information You Share.\n\n\t\tOur Service allows visitors to share information with others, such as comments on editorial content and information shared via social media. When you share information it may as a result become accessible to others, through such mechanisms as search engines. We cannot be responsible for how others with whom you may share information may use that information. (See Paragraph 10 below\u2014The Scope of Our Privacy Policy.)\n\n8. Updating Your Personal Information.\n\n\t\tIt is our policy that, whenever you visit our Service, you should be able to access your personal information, which is information identifying you such as name, email address, billing information or any other information which can reasonably be expected to identify you. If that information is incorrect, we try to provide you ways to update it quickly or to delete it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes, in which case it will be retained for the periods specified in this Privacy Policy. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.\nIf allowed under applicable law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, requests which would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems)).\nWhere we can provide information access and correction, we will do so at no cost to you, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our Service, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.\n\n9. The Information We Share.\n\n\t\tWe do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of EMI, unless one of the following circumstances applies:\na. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of EMI when we have your opt-in or other consent to do so.\nb. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of EMI if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of that information is reasonably necessary to:\n(i)comply with applicable law, regulations, legal process or enforceable governmental request;\n(ii)enforce any of our applicable Terms of Service, including any potential violations;\n(iii)detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or\n(iv)protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of users of our Service or service providers, as well as the general public and EMI as required or permitted by law.\nc. We may share personal information with a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of EMI\u2019s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by EMI about our Service users is among the assets transferred.\nd. We may share your information publicly and with our partners such as third-party content providers, advertisers or connected sites, but in a manner which does not reveal your personally-identifiable information and which is aggregated with other user information to show usage of EMI and third-party products and services offered on our Service and trends based on such categories as age, gender, geographical origination and other demographic characteristics.\n\n10. The Protection of Your Information.\n\n\t\tWe work hard to protect the information provided by, or collected about, the users of our Service, from unauthorized access, or alteration, disclosure or destruction. In particular:\na. We encrypt much of that information using SSL.\nb. We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to our systems and the information collected and stored therein\nc. We restrict access to personal information to those of our employees, contractors and agents, who need to know that information in order to process it for us, who are subject to the obligation of strict confidentiality as relates to that information, and who will be subject to discipline, including termination, if they violate that obligation.\n\n11. The Scope of Our Privacy Policy.\n\n\t\tOur Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by EMI through its Service. However, our Privacy Policy does not apply to the any of the following:\na. services offered by other companies or individuals on non-EMI websites or applications, including any such websites or applications which may be referenced on or linked from our Service; and\nb. the information collected by, and information practices of, other companies, organizations or individuals, who advertise our Service, editorial or advertising content, or any of the products or services offered on our Service, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.\n\n12. Handling Complaints from Our Service Users and Regulatory Authorities.\n\n\t\tWe regularly review our compliance with this Privacy Policy and with any and all industry-recommended best practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. When we receive a formal written complaint, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. This is without prejudice to your right to launch a claim with your local data protection supervisory authority.  We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with the users of our Service directly.\n\n13. California Residents.\n\n\t\tCalifornia residents may choose to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes or choose to opt out of such disclosure.  Our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for directing marketing without your approval.  To make a request or to opt out at any time, please contact us at legal@entrepreneur.com or the other contact information provided below.\n\n14. Privacy Policy Revisions and Updates.\n\n\t\tOur Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time, in which case the Privacy Policy you view will be the most current version and the date of the latest such revision will be identified at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.  We will provide you with 30 days\u2019 notice of any substantial changes to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  \n\n15. Contacting Us.\n\n\t\tIf you have any questions, concerns or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at legal@entrepreneur.com or at the following address:\nEntrepreneur Media, Inc.\n\t\tAttn.: Privacy Policy Issues\n\t\t18061 Fitch Avenue\n\t\tIrvine, CA 92614\n\n", "friendly_summaries": [["We will update this privacy policy whenever we change our terms and conditions.
